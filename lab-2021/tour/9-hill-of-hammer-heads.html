      They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, "KEEP BACK!" "Who are you?" asked the Scarecrow. Then a face showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, "THIS HILL IS OUR HILL, THE HILL OF US HAMMER-HEADS, AND WE DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO EVER CROSS IT!" "But we must cross it," said the Scarecrow. "We're going to the country of the Quadlings to see its ruler, Glinda the Good Witch, so we must." "BUT YOU MUST NOT!" Replied the voice, and there stepped from behind the large rocks the strangest man the travelers had ever seen. He was quite short and stout, standing no more than three feet high and had a big, oversized head, which was smooth on the top and as flat as a hammer. The head was supported by a thick, long, fat neck full of many layers of wrinkles. But the body had no arms at all, not even stubs.
