      "Glinda the Good sat upon a throne of rubies. She was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was pure white but her eyes were sparkling blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl. 'What can I do for you, my child?' she asked."
