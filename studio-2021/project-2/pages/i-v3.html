      The un<span class="variation3">i</span>verse (wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch others call the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary) <span class="variation3">i</span>s composed of an <span class="variation3">i</span>ndef<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>te and perhaps <span class="variation3">i</span>nf<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>te number of hexagonal galler<span class="variation3">i</span>es, w<span class="variation3">i</span>th vast a<span class="variation3">i</span>r shafts between, surrounded by very low ra<span class="variation3">i</span>l<span class="variation3">i</span>ngs. From any of the hexagons one can see, <span class="variation3">i</span>nterm<span class="variation3">i</span>nably, the upper and lower floors. The d<span class="variation3">i</span>str<span class="variation3">i</span>but<span class="variation3">i</span>on of the galler<span class="variation3">i</span>es <span class="variation3">i</span>s <span class="variation3">i</span>nvar<span class="variation3">i</span>able. Twenty shelves, f<span class="variation3">i</span>ve long shelves per s<span class="variation3">i</span>de, cover all the s<span class="variation3">i</span>des except two; the<span class="variation3">i</span>r he<span class="variation3">i</span>ght, wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch <span class="variation3">i</span>s the d<span class="variation3">i</span>stance from floor to ce<span class="variation3">i</span>l<span class="variation3">i</span>ng, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free s<span class="variation3">i</span>des leads to a narrow hallway wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch opens onto another gallery, <span class="variation3">i</span>dent<span class="variation3">i</span>cal to the f<span class="variation3">i</span>rst and to all the rest. To the left and r<span class="variation3">i</span>ght of the hallway there are two very small closets. <span class="variation3">I</span>n the f<span class="variation3">i</span>rst, one may sleep stand<span class="variation3">i</span>ng up; <span class="variation3">i</span>n the other, sat<span class="variation3">i</span>sfy one's fecal necess<span class="variation3">i</span>t<span class="variation3">i</span>es. Also through here passes a sp<span class="variation3">i</span>ral sta<span class="variation3">i</span>rway, wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch s<span class="variation3">i</span>nks abysmally and soars upwards to remote d<span class="variation3">i</span>stances. <span class="variation3">I</span>n the hallway there <span class="variation3">i</span>s a m<span class="variation3">i</span>rror wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch fa<span class="variation3">i</span>thfully dupl<span class="variation3">i</span>cates all appearances.

      L<span class="variation3">i</span>ke all men of the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary, <span class="variation3">I</span> have traveled <span class="variation3">i</span>n my youth; <span class="variation3">I</span> have wandered <span class="variation3">i</span>n search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly dec<span class="variation3">i</span>pher what <span class="variation3">I</span> wr<span class="variation3">i</span>te, <span class="variation3">I</span> am prepar<span class="variation3">i</span>ng to d<span class="variation3">i</span>e just a few leagues from the hexagon <span class="variation3">i</span>n wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch <span class="variation3">I</span> was born.

The <span class="variation3">i</span>deal<span class="variation3">i</span>sts argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our <span class="variation3">i</span>ntu<span class="variation3">i</span>t<span class="variation3">i</span>on of space. They reason that a tr<span class="variation3">i</span>angular or pentagonal room <span class="variation3">i</span>s <span class="variation3">i</span>nconce<span class="variation3">i</span>vable.

Th<span class="variation3">i</span>s d<span class="variation3">i</span>ctum, we shall see, <span class="variation3">i</span>s not ent<span class="variation3">i</span>rely fallac<span class="variation3">i</span>ous.)
      <br><br>
      For a long t<span class="variation3">i</span>me <span class="variation3">i</span>t was bel<span class="variation3">i</span>eved that these <span class="variation3">i</span>mpenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. <span class="variation3">I</span>t <span class="variation3">i</span>s true that the most anc<span class="variation3">i</span>ent men, the f<span class="variation3">i</span>rst l<span class="variation3">i</span>brar<span class="variation3">i</span>ans, used a language qu<span class="variation3">i</span>te d<span class="variation3">i</span>fferent from the one we now speak; <span class="variation3">i</span>t <span class="variation3">i</span>s true that a few m<span class="variation3">i</span>les to the r<span class="variation3">i</span>ght the tongue <span class="variation3">i</span>s d<span class="variation3">i</span>alect<span class="variation3">i</span>cal and that n<span class="variation3">i</span>nety floors farther up, <span class="variation3">i</span>t <span class="variation3">i</span>s <span class="variation3">i</span>ncomprehens<span class="variation3">i</span>ble. All th<span class="variation3">i</span>s, <span class="variation3">I</span> repeat, <span class="variation3">i</span>s true, but four hundred and ten pages of <span class="variation3">i</span>nalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how d<span class="variation3">i</span>alect<span class="variation3">i</span>cal or rud<span class="variation3">i</span>mentary <span class="variation3">i</span>t may be. Some <span class="variation3">i</span>ns<span class="variation3">i</span>nuated that each letter could <span class="variation3">i</span>nfluence the follow<span class="variation3">i</span>ng one and that the value of MCV <span class="variation3">i</span>n the th<span class="variation3">i</span>rd l<span class="variation3">i</span>ne of page 7 (1) was not the one the same ser<span class="variation3">i</span>es may have <span class="variation3">i</span>n another pos<span class="variation3">i</span>t<span class="variation3">i</span>on on another page, but th<span class="variation3">i</span>s vague thes<span class="variation3">i</span>s d<span class="variation3">i</span>d not preva<span class="variation3">i</span>l. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, th<span class="variation3">i</span>s conjecture has been accepted, though not <span class="variation3">i</span>n the sense <span class="variation3">i</span>n wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch <span class="variation3">i</span>t was formulated by <span class="variation3">i</span>ts or<span class="variation3">i</span>g<span class="variation3">i</span>nators.
      <br><br>
      F<span class="variation3">i</span>ve hundred years ago, the ch<span class="variation3">i</span>ef of an upper hexagon (2) came upon a book as confus<span class="variation3">i</span>ng as the others, but wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch had nearly two pages of homogeneous l<span class="variation3">i</span>nes. He showed h<span class="variation3">i</span>s f<span class="variation3">i</span>nd to a wander<span class="variation3">i</span>ng decoder who told h<span class="variation3">i</span>m the l<span class="variation3">i</span>nes were wr<span class="variation3">i</span>tten <span class="variation3">i</span>n Portuguese; others sa<span class="variation3">i</span>d they were Y<span class="variation3">i</span>dd<span class="variation3">i</span>sh. W<span class="variation3">i</span>th<span class="variation3">i</span>n a century, the language was establ<span class="variation3">i</span>shed: a Samoyed<span class="variation3">i</span>c L<span class="variation3">i</span>thuan<span class="variation3">i</span>an d<span class="variation3">i</span>alect of Guaran<span class="variation3">i</span>, w<span class="variation3">i</span>th class<span class="variation3">i</span>cal Arab<span class="variation3">i</span>an <span class="variation3">i</span>nflect<span class="variation3">i</span>ons. The content was also dec<span class="variation3">i</span>phered: some not<span class="variation3">i</span>ons of comb<span class="variation3">i</span>nat<span class="variation3">i</span>ve analys<span class="variation3">i</span>s, <span class="variation3">i</span>llustrated w<span class="variation3">i</span>th examples of var<span class="variation3">i</span>at<span class="variation3">i</span>ons w<span class="variation3">i</span>th unl<span class="variation3">i</span>m<span class="variation3">i</span>ted repet<span class="variation3">i</span>t<span class="variation3">i</span>on. These examples made <span class="variation3">i</span>t poss<span class="variation3">i</span>ble for a l<span class="variation3">i</span>brar<span class="variation3">i</span>an of gen<span class="variation3">i</span>us to d<span class="variation3">i</span>scover the fundamental law of the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary. Th<span class="variation3">i</span>s th<span class="variation3">i</span>nker observed that all the books, no matter how d<span class="variation3">i</span>verse they m<span class="variation3">i</span>ght be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the per<span class="variation3">i</span>od, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch travelers have conf<span class="variation3">i</span>rmed: <span class="variation3">I</span>n the vast L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary there are no two <span class="variation3">i</span>dent<span class="variation3">i</span>cal books. From these two <span class="variation3">i</span>ncontrovert<span class="variation3">i</span>ble prem<span class="variation3">i</span>ses he deduced that the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary <span class="variation3">i</span>s total and that <span class="variation3">i</span>ts shelves reg<span class="variation3">i</span>ster all the poss<span class="variation3">i</span>ble comb<span class="variation3">i</span>nat<span class="variation3">i</span>ons of the twenty-odd orthograph<span class="variation3">i</span>cal symbols (a number wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch, though extremely vast, <span class="variation3">i</span>s not <span class="variation3">i</span>nf<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>te): Everyth<span class="variation3">i</span>ng: the m<span class="variation3">i</span>nutely deta<span class="variation3">i</span>led h<span class="variation3">i</span>story of the future, the archangels' autob<span class="variation3">i</span>ograph<span class="variation3">i</span>es, the fa<span class="variation3">i</span>thful catalogues of the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstrat<span class="variation3">i</span>on of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstrat<span class="variation3">i</span>on of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnost<span class="variation3">i</span>c gospel of Bas<span class="variation3">i</span>l<span class="variation3">i</span>des, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translat<span class="variation3">i</span>on of every book <span class="variation3">i</span>n all languages, the <span class="variation3">i</span>nterpolat<span class="variation3">i</span>ons of every book <span class="variation3">i</span>n all books.
      <br><br>
      When <span class="variation3">i</span>t was procla<span class="variation3">i</span>med that the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary conta<span class="variation3">i</span>ned all books, the f<span class="variation3">i</span>rst <span class="variation3">i</span>mpress<span class="variation3">i</span>on was one of extravagant happ<span class="variation3">i</span>ness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an <span class="variation3">i</span>ntact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solut<span class="variation3">i</span>on d<span class="variation3">i</span>d not ex<span class="variation3">i</span>st <span class="variation3">i</span>n some hexagon. The un<span class="variation3">i</span>verse was just<span class="variation3">i</span>f<span class="variation3">i</span>ed, the un<span class="variation3">i</span>verse suddenly usurped the unl<span class="variation3">i</span>m<span class="variation3">i</span>ted d<span class="variation3">i</span>mens<span class="variation3">i</span>ons of hope. At that t<span class="variation3">i</span>me a great deal was sa<span class="variation3">i</span>d about the V<span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>cat<span class="variation3">i</span>ons: books of apology and prophecy wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch v<span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>cated for all t<span class="variation3">i</span>me the acts of every man <span class="variation3">i</span>n the un<span class="variation3">i</span>verse and reta<span class="variation3">i</span>ned prod<span class="variation3">i</span>g<span class="variation3">i</span>ous arcana for h<span class="variation3">i</span>s future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned the<span class="variation3">i</span>r sweet nat<span class="variation3">i</span>ve hexagons and rushed up the sta<span class="variation3">i</span>rways, urged on by the va<span class="variation3">i</span>n <span class="variation3">i</span>ntent<span class="variation3">i</span>on of f<span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>ng the<span class="variation3">i</span>r V<span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>cat<span class="variation3">i</span>on. These p<span class="variation3">i</span>lgr<span class="variation3">i</span>ms d<span class="variation3">i</span>sputed <span class="variation3">i</span>n the narrow corr<span class="variation3">i</span>dors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the d<span class="variation3">i</span>v<span class="variation3">i</span>ne sta<span class="variation3">i</span>rways, flung the decept<span class="variation3">i</span>ve books <span class="variation3">i</span>nto the a<span class="variation3">i</span>r shafts, met the<span class="variation3">i</span>r death cast down <span class="variation3">i</span>n a s<span class="variation3">i</span>m<span class="variation3">i</span>lar fash<span class="variation3">i</span>on by the <span class="variation3">i</span>nhab<span class="variation3">i</span>tants of remote reg<span class="variation3">i</span>ons. Others went mad... The V<span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>cat<span class="variation3">i</span>ons ex<span class="variation3">i</span>st (<span class="variation3">I</span> have seen two wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not <span class="variation3">i</span>mag<span class="variation3">i</span>nary) but the searchers d<span class="variation3">i</span>d not remember that the poss<span class="variation3">i</span>b<span class="variation3">i</span>l<span class="variation3">i</span>ty of a man's f<span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>ng h<span class="variation3">i</span>s V<span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>cat<span class="variation3">i</span>on, or some treacherous var<span class="variation3">i</span>at<span class="variation3">i</span>on thereof, can be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that t<span class="variation3">i</span>me <span class="variation3">i</span>t was also hoped that a clar<span class="variation3">i</span>f<span class="variation3">i</span>cat<span class="variation3">i</span>on of human<span class="variation3">i</span>ty's bas<span class="variation3">i</span>c myster<span class="variation3">i</span>es - the or<span class="variation3">i</span>g<span class="variation3">i</span>n of the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary and of t<span class="variation3">i</span>me - m<span class="variation3">i</span>ght be found. <span class="variation3">I</span>t <span class="variation3">i</span>s ver<span class="variation3">i</span>s<span class="variation3">i</span>m<span class="variation3">i</span>lar that these grave myster<span class="variation3">i</span>es could be expla<span class="variation3">i</span>ned <span class="variation3">i</span>n words: <span class="variation3">i</span>f the language of ph<span class="variation3">i</span>losophers <span class="variation3">i</span>s not suff<span class="variation3">i</span>c<span class="variation3">i</span>ent, the mult<span class="variation3">i</span>form L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary w<span class="variation3">i</span>ll have produced the unprecedented language requ<span class="variation3">i</span>red, w<span class="variation3">i</span>th <span class="variation3">i</span>ts vocabular<span class="variation3">i</span>es and grammars. For four centur<span class="variation3">i</span>es now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are off<span class="variation3">i</span>c<span class="variation3">i</span>al searchers, <span class="variation3">i</span>nqu<span class="variation3">i</span>s<span class="variation3">i</span>tors. <span class="variation3">I</span> have seen them <span class="variation3">i</span>n the performance of the<span class="variation3">i</span>r funct<span class="variation3">i</span>on: they always arr<span class="variation3">i</span>ve extremely t<span class="variation3">i</span>red from the<span class="variation3">i</span>r journeys; they speak of a broken sta<span class="variation3">i</span>rway wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch almost k<span class="variation3">i</span>lled them; they talk w<span class="variation3">i</span>th the l<span class="variation3">i</span>brar<span class="variation3">i</span>an of galler<span class="variation3">i</span>es and sta<span class="variation3">i</span>rs; somet<span class="variation3">i</span>mes they p<span class="variation3">i</span>ck up the nearest volume and leaf through <span class="variation3">i</span>t, look<span class="variation3">i</span>ng for <span class="variation3">i</span>nfamous words. Obv<span class="variation3">i</span>ously, no one expects to d<span class="variation3">i</span>scover anyth<span class="variation3">i</span>ng.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, th<span class="variation3">i</span>s <span class="variation3">i</span>nord<span class="variation3">i</span>nate hope was followed by an excess<span class="variation3">i</span>ve depress<span class="variation3">i</span>on. The cert<span class="variation3">i</span>tude that some shelf <span class="variation3">i</span>n some hexagon held prec<span class="variation3">i</span>ous books and that these prec<span class="variation3">i</span>ous books were <span class="variation3">i</span>naccess<span class="variation3">i</span>ble, seemed almost <span class="variation3">i</span>ntolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols unt<span class="variation3">i</span>l they constructed, by an <span class="variation3">i</span>mprobable g<span class="variation3">i</span>ft of chance, these canon<span class="variation3">i</span>cal books. The author<span class="variation3">i</span>t<span class="variation3">i</span>es were obl<span class="variation3">i</span>ged to <span class="variation3">i</span>ssue severe orders. The sect d<span class="variation3">i</span>sappeared, but <span class="variation3">i</span>n my ch<span class="variation3">i</span>ldhood <span class="variation3">I</span> have seen old men who, for long per<span class="variation3">i</span>ods of t<span class="variation3">i</span>me, would h<span class="variation3">i</span>de <span class="variation3">i</span>n the latr<span class="variation3">i</span>nes w<span class="variation3">i</span>th some metal d<span class="variation3">i</span>sks <span class="variation3">i</span>n a forb<span class="variation3">i</span>dden d<span class="variation3">i</span>ce cup and feebly m<span class="variation3">i</span>m<span class="variation3">i</span>c the d<span class="variation3">i</span>v<span class="variation3">i</span>ne d<span class="variation3">i</span>sorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, <span class="variation3">i</span>nversely, bel<span class="variation3">i</span>eved that <span class="variation3">i</span>t was fundamental to el<span class="variation3">i</span>m<span class="variation3">i</span>nate useless works. They <span class="variation3">i</span>nvaded the hexagons, showed credent<span class="variation3">i</span>als wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch were not always false, leafed through a volume w<span class="variation3">i</span>th d<span class="variation3">i</span>spleasure and condemned whole shelves: the<span class="variation3">i</span>r hyg<span class="variation3">i</span>en<span class="variation3">i</span>c, ascet<span class="variation3">i</span>c furor caused the senseless perd<span class="variation3">i</span>t<span class="variation3">i</span>on of m<span class="variation3">i</span>ll<span class="variation3">i</span>ons of books. The<span class="variation3">i</span>r name <span class="variation3">i</span>s execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by th<span class="variation3">i</span>s frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary <span class="variation3">i</span>s so enormous that any reduct<span class="variation3">i</span>on of human or<span class="variation3">i</span>g<span class="variation3">i</span>n <span class="variation3">i</span>s <span class="variation3">i</span>nf<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>tes<span class="variation3">i</span>mal. The other: every copy <span class="variation3">i</span>s un<span class="variation3">i</span>que, <span class="variation3">i</span>rreplaceable, but (s<span class="variation3">i</span>nce the L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary <span class="variation3">i</span>s total) there are always several hundred thousand <span class="variation3">i</span>mperfect facs<span class="variation3">i</span>m<span class="variation3">i</span>les: works wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch d<span class="variation3">i</span>ffer only <span class="variation3">i</span>n a letter or a comma. Counter to general op<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>on, <span class="variation3">I</span> venture to suppose that the consequences of the Pur<span class="variation3">i</span>f<span class="variation3">i</span>ers' depredat<span class="variation3">i</span>ons have been exaggerated by the horror these fanat<span class="variation3">i</span>cs produced. They were urged on by the del<span class="variation3">i</span>r<span class="variation3">i</span>um of try<span class="variation3">i</span>ng to reach the books <span class="variation3">i</span>n the Cr<span class="variation3">i</span>mson Hexagon: books whose format <span class="variation3">i</span>s smaller than usual, all-powerful, <span class="variation3">i</span>llustrated and mag<span class="variation3">i</span>cal.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another superst<span class="variation3">i</span>t<span class="variation3">i</span>on of that t<span class="variation3">i</span>me: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf <span class="variation3">i</span>n some hexagon (men reasoned) there must ex<span class="variation3">i</span>st a book wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch <span class="variation3">i</span>s the formula and perfect compend<span class="variation3">i</span>um of all the rest: some l<span class="variation3">i</span>brar<span class="variation3">i</span>an has gone through <span class="variation3">i</span>t and he <span class="variation3">i</span>s analogous to a god. <span class="variation3">I</span>n the language of th<span class="variation3">i</span>s zone vest<span class="variation3">i</span>ges of th<span class="variation3">i</span>s remote funct<span class="variation3">i</span>onary's cult st<span class="variation3">i</span>ll pers<span class="variation3">i</span>st. Many wandered <span class="variation3">i</span>n search of H<span class="variation3">i</span>m. For a century they have exhausted <span class="variation3">i</span>n va<span class="variation3">i</span>n the most var<span class="variation3">i</span>ed areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch housed H<span class="variation3">i</span>m? Someone proposed a regress<span class="variation3">i</span>ve method: To locate book A, consult f<span class="variation3">i</span>rst book B wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch <span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>cates A's pos<span class="variation3">i</span>t<span class="variation3">i</span>on; to locate book B, consult f<span class="variation3">i</span>rst a book C, and so on to <span class="variation3">i</span>nf<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>ty... <span class="variation3">I</span>n adventures such as these, <span class="variation3">I</span> have squandered and wasted my years. <span class="variation3">I</span>t does not seem unl<span class="variation3">i</span>kely to me that there <span class="variation3">i</span>s a total book on some shelf of the un<span class="variation3">i</span>verse (3) ; <span class="variation3">I</span> pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though <span class="variation3">i</span>t were thousands of years ago! - may have exam<span class="variation3">i</span>ned and read <span class="variation3">i</span>t. <span class="variation3">I</span>f honor and w<span class="variation3">i</span>sdom and happ<span class="variation3">i</span>ness are not for me, let them be for others.

      1. The or<span class="variation3">i</span>g<span class="variation3">i</span>nal manuscr<span class="variation3">i</span>pt does not conta<span class="variation3">i</span>n d<span class="variation3">i</span>g<span class="variation3">i</span>ts or cap<span class="variation3">i</span>tal letters. The punctuat<span class="variation3">i</span>on has been l<span class="variation3">i</span>m<span class="variation3">i</span>ted to the comma and the per<span class="variation3">i</span>od. These two s<span class="variation3">i</span>gns, the space and the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the twenty-f<span class="variation3">i</span>ve symbols cons<span class="variation3">i</span>dered suff<span class="variation3">i</span>c<span class="variation3">i</span>ent by th<span class="variation3">i</span>s unknown author. (Ed<span class="variation3">i</span>tor's note.)

      2. Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Su<span class="variation3">i</span>c<span class="variation3">i</span>de and pulmonary d<span class="variation3">i</span>seases have destroyed that proport<span class="variation3">i</span>on. A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at t<span class="variation3">i</span>mes <span class="variation3">I</span> have traveled for many n<span class="variation3">i</span>ghts through corr<span class="variation3">i</span>dors and along pol<span class="variation3">i</span>shed sta<span class="variation3">i</span>rways w<span class="variation3">i</span>thout f<span class="variation3">i</span>nd<span class="variation3">i</span>ng a s<span class="variation3">i</span>ngle l<span class="variation3">i</span>brar<span class="variation3">i</span>an.

      3. <span class="variation3">I</span> repeat: <span class="variation3">i</span>t suff<span class="variation3">i</span>ces that a book be poss<span class="variation3">i</span>ble for <span class="variation3">i</span>t to ex<span class="variation3">i</span>st. Only the <span class="variation3">i</span>mposs<span class="variation3">i</span>ble <span class="variation3">i</span>s excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books wh<span class="variation3">i</span>ch d<span class="variation3">i</span>scuss and negate and demonstrate th<span class="variation3">i</span>s poss<span class="variation3">i</span>b<span class="variation3">i</span>l<span class="variation3">i</span>ty and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.

Let<span class="variation3">i</span>z<span class="variation3">i</span>a Alvarez de Toledo has observed that th<span class="variation3">i</span>s vast L<span class="variation3">i</span>brary <span class="variation3">i</span>s useless: r<span class="variation3">i</span>gorously speak<span class="variation3">i</span>ng, a s<span class="variation3">i</span>ngle volume would be suff<span class="variation3">i</span>c<span class="variation3">i</span>ent, a volume of ord<span class="variation3">i</span>nary format, pr<span class="variation3">i</span>nted <span class="variation3">i</span>n n<span class="variation3">i</span>ne or ten po<span class="variation3">i</span>nt type, conta<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>ng an <span class="variation3">i</span>nf<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>te number <span class="variation3">i</span>f <span class="variation3">i</span>nf<span class="variation3">i</span>n<span class="variation3">i</span>tely th<span class="variation3">i</span>n leaves.

The handl<span class="variation3">i</span>ng of th<span class="variation3">i</span>s s<span class="variation3">i</span>lky vade mecum would not be conven<span class="variation3">i</span>ent: each apparent page would unfold <span class="variation3">i</span>nto other analogous ones; the <span class="variation3">i</span>nconce<span class="variation3">i</span>vable m<span class="variation3">i</span>ddle page would have no reverse.
