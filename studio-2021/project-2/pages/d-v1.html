      The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which others call the Library) is compose<span class="variation1">d</span> of an in<span class="variation1">d</span>efinite an<span class="variation1">d</span> perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surroun<span class="variation1">d</span>e<span class="variation1">d</span> by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper an<span class="variation1">d</span> lower floors. The <span class="variation1">d</span>istribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per si<span class="variation1">d</span>e, cover all the si<span class="variation1">d</span>es except two; their height, which is the <span class="variation1">d</span>istance from floor to ceiling, scarcely excee<span class="variation1">d</span>s that of a normal bookcase. One of the free si<span class="variation1">d</span>es lea<span class="variation1">d</span>s to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, i<span class="variation1">d</span>entical to the first an<span class="variation1">d</span> to all the rest. To the left an<span class="variation1">d</span> right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep stan<span class="variation1">d</span>ing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally an<span class="variation1">d</span> soars upwar<span class="variation1">d</span>s to remote <span class="variation1">d</span>istances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully <span class="variation1">d</span>uplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory <span class="variation1">d</span>uplication?); I prefer to <span class="variation1">d</span>ream that its polishe<span class="variation1">d</span> surfaces represent an<span class="variation1">d</span> promise the infinite... Light is provi<span class="variation1">d</span>e<span class="variation1">d</span> by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally place<span class="variation1">d</span>, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Library, I have travele<span class="variation1">d</span> in my youth; I have wan<span class="variation1">d</span>ere<span class="variation1">d</span> in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can har<span class="variation1">d</span>ly <span class="variation1">d</span>ecipher what I write, I am preparing to <span class="variation1">d</span>ie just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am <span class="variation1">d</span>ea<span class="variation1">d</span>, there will be no lack of pious han<span class="variation1">d</span>s to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my bo<span class="variation1">d</span>y will sink en<span class="variation1">d</span>lessly an<span class="variation1">d</span> <span class="variation1">d</span>ecay an<span class="variation1">d</span> <span class="variation1">d</span>issolve in the win<span class="variation1">d</span> generate<span class="variation1">d</span> by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unen<span class="variation1">d</span>ing. The i<span class="variation1">d</span>ealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous an<span class="variation1">d</span> which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their wor<span class="variation1">d</span>s, obscure. This cyclical book is Go<span class="variation1">d</span>.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic <span class="variation1">d</span>ictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons an<span class="variation1">d</span> whose circumference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hun<span class="variation1">d</span>re<span class="variation1">d</span> an<span class="variation1">d</span> ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters <span class="variation1">d</span>o not in<span class="variation1">d</span>icate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seeme<span class="variation1">d</span> mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose <span class="variation1">d</span>iscovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose imme<span class="variation1">d</span>iate corollary is the future eternity of the worl<span class="variation1">d</span>, cannot be place<span class="variation1">d</span> in <span class="variation1">d</span>oubt by any reasonable min<span class="variation1">d</span>. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the pro<span class="variation1">d</span>uct of chance or of malevolent <span class="variation1">d</span>emiurgi; the universe, with its elegant en<span class="variation1">d</span>owment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler an<span class="variation1">d</span> latrines for the seate<span class="variation1">d</span> librarian, can only be the work of a go<span class="variation1">d</span>. To perceive the <span class="variation1">d</span>istance between the <span class="variation1">d</span>ivine an<span class="variation1">d</span> the human, it is enough to compare these cru<span class="variation1">d</span>e wavering symbols which my fallible han<span class="variation1">d</span> scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters insi<span class="variation1">d</span>e: punctual, <span class="variation1">d</span>elicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Secon<span class="variation1">d</span>: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.^ This fin<span class="variation1">d</span>ing ma<span class="variation1">d</span>e it possible, three hun<span class="variation1">d</span>re<span class="variation1">d</span> years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library an<span class="variation1">d</span> solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture ha<span class="variation1">d</span> <span class="variation1">d</span>eciphere<span class="variation1">d</span>: the formless an<span class="variation1">d</span> chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was ma<span class="variation1">d</span>e up of the letters MCV, perversely repeate<span class="variation1">d</span> from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulte<span class="variation1">d</span> in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyrami<span class="variation1">d</span>s. This much is alrea<span class="variation1">d</span>y known: for every sensible line of straightforwar<span class="variation1">d</span> statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles an<span class="variation1">d</span> incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repu<span class="variation1">d</span>iate the vain an<span class="variation1">d</span> superstitious custom of fin<span class="variation1">d</span>ing a meaning in books an<span class="variation1">d</span> equate it with that of fin<span class="variation1">d</span>ing a meaning in <span class="variation1">d</span>reams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They a<span class="variation1">d</span>mit that the inventors of this writing imitate<span class="variation1">d</span> the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is acci<span class="variation1">d</span>ental an<span class="variation1">d</span> that the books signify nothing in themselves. This <span class="variation1">d</span>ictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it was believe<span class="variation1">d</span> that these impenetrable books correspon<span class="variation1">d</span>e<span class="variation1">d</span> to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, use<span class="variation1">d</span> a language quite <span class="variation1">d</span>ifferent from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is <span class="variation1">d</span>ialectical an<span class="variation1">d</span> that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hun<span class="variation1">d</span>re<span class="variation1">d</span> an<span class="variation1">d</span> ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspon<span class="variation1">d</span> to any language, no matter how <span class="variation1">d</span>ialectical or ru<span class="variation1">d</span>imentary it may be. Some insinuate<span class="variation1">d</span> that each letter coul<span class="variation1">d</span> influence the following one an<span class="variation1">d</span> that the value of MCV in the thir<span class="variation1">d</span> line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis <span class="variation1">d</span>i<span class="variation1">d</span> not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepte<span class="variation1">d</span>, though not in the sense in which it was formulate<span class="variation1">d</span> by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five hun<span class="variation1">d</span>re<span class="variation1">d</span> years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which ha<span class="variation1">d</span> nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showe<span class="variation1">d</span> his fin<span class="variation1">d</span> to a wan<span class="variation1">d</span>ering <span class="variation1">d</span>eco<span class="variation1">d</span>er who tol<span class="variation1">d</span> him the lines were written in Portuguese; others sai<span class="variation1">d</span> they were Yi<span class="variation1">d</span><span class="variation1">d</span>ish. Within a century, the language was establishe<span class="variation1">d</span>: a Samoye<span class="variation1">d</span>ic Lithuanian <span class="variation1">d</span>ialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also <span class="variation1">d</span>eciphere<span class="variation1">d</span>: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrate<span class="variation1">d</span> with examples of variations with unlimite<span class="variation1">d</span> repetition. These examples ma<span class="variation1">d</span>e it possible for a librarian of genius to <span class="variation1">d</span>iscover the fun<span class="variation1">d</span>amental law of the Library. This thinker observe<span class="variation1">d</span> that all the books, no matter how <span class="variation1">d</span>iverse they might be, are ma<span class="variation1">d</span>e up of the same elements: the space, the perio<span class="variation1">d</span>, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also allege<span class="variation1">d</span> a fact which travelers have confirme<span class="variation1">d</span>: In the vast Library there are no two i<span class="variation1">d</span>entical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he <span class="variation1">d</span>e<span class="variation1">d</span>uce<span class="variation1">d</span> that the Library is total an<span class="variation1">d</span> that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-o<span class="variation1">d</span><span class="variation1">d</span> orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely <span class="variation1">d</span>etaile<span class="variation1">d</span> history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousan<span class="variation1">d</span>s an<span class="variation1">d</span> thousan<span class="variation1">d</span>s of false catalogues, the <span class="variation1">d</span>emonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the <span class="variation1">d</span>emonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basili<span class="variation1">d</span>es, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your <span class="variation1">d</span>eath, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was proclaime<span class="variation1">d</span> that the Library containe<span class="variation1">d</span> all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact an<span class="variation1">d</span> secret treasure. There was no personal or worl<span class="variation1">d</span> problem whose eloquent solution <span class="variation1">d</span>i<span class="variation1">d</span> not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justifie<span class="variation1">d</span>, the universe su<span class="variation1">d</span><span class="variation1">d</span>enly usurpe<span class="variation1">d</span> the unlimite<span class="variation1">d</span> <span class="variation1">d</span>imensions of hope. At that time a great <span class="variation1">d</span>eal was sai<span class="variation1">d</span> about the Vin<span class="variation1">d</span>ications: books of apology an<span class="variation1">d</span> prophecy which vin<span class="variation1">d</span>icate<span class="variation1">d</span> for all time the acts of every man in the universe an<span class="variation1">d</span> retaine<span class="variation1">d</span> pro<span class="variation1">d</span>igious arcana for his future. Thousan<span class="variation1">d</span>s of the gree<span class="variation1">d</span>y aban<span class="variation1">d</span>one<span class="variation1">d</span> their sweet native hexagons an<span class="variation1">d</span> rushe<span class="variation1">d</span> up the stairways, urge<span class="variation1">d</span> on by the vain intention of fin<span class="variation1">d</span>ing their Vin<span class="variation1">d</span>ication. These pilgrims <span class="variation1">d</span>ispute<span class="variation1">d</span> in the narrow corri<span class="variation1">d</span>ors, proferre<span class="variation1">d</span> <span class="variation1">d</span>ark curses, strangle<span class="variation1">d</span> each other on the <span class="variation1">d</span>ivine stairways, flung the <span class="variation1">d</span>eceptive books into the air shafts, met their <span class="variation1">d</span>eath cast <span class="variation1">d</span>own in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went ma<span class="variation1">d</span>... The Vin<span class="variation1">d</span>ications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers <span class="variation1">d</span>i<span class="variation1">d</span> not remember that the possibility of a man's fin<span class="variation1">d</span>ing his Vin<span class="variation1">d</span>ication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be compute<span class="variation1">d</span> as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hope<span class="variation1">d</span> that a clarification of humanity's basic mysteries - the origin of the Library an<span class="variation1">d</span> of time - might be foun<span class="variation1">d</span>. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries coul<span class="variation1">d</span> be explaine<span class="variation1">d</span> in wor<span class="variation1">d</span>s: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have pro<span class="variation1">d</span>uce<span class="variation1">d</span> the unprece<span class="variation1">d</span>ente<span class="variation1">d</span> language require<span class="variation1">d</span>, with its vocabularies an<span class="variation1">d</span> grammars. For four centuries now men have exhauste<span class="variation1">d</span> the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tire<span class="variation1">d</span> from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost kille<span class="variation1">d</span> them; they talk with the librarian of galleries an<span class="variation1">d</span> stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume an<span class="variation1">d</span> leaf through it, looking for infamous wor<span class="variation1">d</span>s. Obviously, no one expects to <span class="variation1">d</span>iscover anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inor<span class="variation1">d</span>inate hope was followe<span class="variation1">d</span> by an excessive <span class="variation1">d</span>epression. The certitu<span class="variation1">d</span>e that some shelf in some hexagon hel<span class="variation1">d</span> precious books an<span class="variation1">d</span> that these precious books were inaccessible, seeme<span class="variation1">d</span> almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggeste<span class="variation1">d</span> that the searches shoul<span class="variation1">d</span> cease an<span class="variation1">d</span> that all men shoul<span class="variation1">d</span> juggle letters an<span class="variation1">d</span> symbols until they constructe<span class="variation1">d</span>, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were oblige<span class="variation1">d</span> to issue severe or<span class="variation1">d</span>ers. The sect <span class="variation1">d</span>isappeare<span class="variation1">d</span>, but in my chil<span class="variation1">d</span>hoo<span class="variation1">d</span> I have seen ol<span class="variation1">d</span> men who, for long perio<span class="variation1">d</span>s of time, woul<span class="variation1">d</span> hi<span class="variation1">d</span>e in the latrines with some metal <span class="variation1">d</span>isks in a forbi<span class="variation1">d</span><span class="variation1">d</span>en <span class="variation1">d</span>ice cup an<span class="variation1">d</span> feebly mimic the <span class="variation1">d</span>ivine <span class="variation1">d</span>isor<span class="variation1">d</span>er.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, believe<span class="variation1">d</span> that it was fun<span class="variation1">d</span>amental to eliminate useless works. They inva<span class="variation1">d</span>e<span class="variation1">d</span> the hexagons, showe<span class="variation1">d</span> cre<span class="variation1">d</span>entials which were not always false, leafe<span class="variation1">d</span> through a volume with <span class="variation1">d</span>ispleasure an<span class="variation1">d</span> con<span class="variation1">d</span>emne<span class="variation1">d</span> whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor cause<span class="variation1">d</span> the senseless per<span class="variation1">d</span>ition of millions of books. Their name is execrate<span class="variation1">d</span>, but those who <span class="variation1">d</span>eplore the "treasures" <span class="variation1">d</span>estroye<span class="variation1">d</span> by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any re<span class="variation1">d</span>uction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hun<span class="variation1">d</span>re<span class="variation1">d</span> thousan<span class="variation1">d</span> imperfect facsimiles: works which <span class="variation1">d</span>iffer only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' <span class="variation1">d</span>epre<span class="variation1">d</span>ations have been exaggerate<span class="variation1">d</span> by the horror these fanatics pro<span class="variation1">d</span>uce<span class="variation1">d</span>. They were urge<span class="variation1">d</span> on by the <span class="variation1">d</span>elirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrate<span class="variation1">d</span> an<span class="variation1">d</span> magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasone<span class="variation1">d</span>) there must exist a book which is the formula an<span class="variation1">d</span> perfect compen<span class="variation1">d</span>ium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it an<span class="variation1">d</span> he is analogous to a go<span class="variation1">d</span>. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wan<span class="variation1">d</span>ere<span class="variation1">d</span> in search of Him. For a century they have exhauste<span class="variation1">d</span> in vain the most varie<span class="variation1">d</span> areas. How coul<span class="variation1">d</span> one locate the venerate<span class="variation1">d</span> an<span class="variation1">d</span> secret hexagon which house<span class="variation1">d</span> Him? Someone propose<span class="variation1">d</span> a regressive metho<span class="variation1">d</span>: To locate book A, consult first book B which in<span class="variation1">d</span>icates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, an<span class="variation1">d</span> so on to infinity... In a<span class="variation1">d</span>ventures such as these, I have squan<span class="variation1">d</span>ere<span class="variation1">d</span> an<span class="variation1">d</span> waste<span class="variation1">d</span> my years. It <span class="variation1">d</span>oes not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe 3 ; I pray to the unknown go<span class="variation1">d</span>s that a man - just one, even though it were thousan<span class="variation1">d</span>s of years ago! - may have examine<span class="variation1">d</span> an<span class="variation1">d</span> rea<span class="variation1">d</span> it. If honor an<span class="variation1">d</span> wis<span class="variation1">d</span>om an<span class="variation1">d</span> happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outrage<span class="variation1">d</span> an<span class="variation1">d</span> annihilate<span class="variation1">d</span>, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justifie<span class="variation1">d</span>. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library an<span class="variation1">d</span> that the reasonable (an<span class="variation1">d</span> even humble an<span class="variation1">d</span> pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in <span class="variation1">d</span>anger of changing into others an<span class="variation1">d</span> affirm, negate an<span class="variation1">d</span> confuse everything like a <span class="variation1">d</span>elirious <span class="variation1">d</span>ivinity." These wor<span class="variation1">d</span>s, which not only <span class="variation1">d</span>enounce the <span class="variation1">d</span>isor<span class="variation1">d</span>er but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste an<span class="variation1">d</span> <span class="variation1">d</span>esperate ignorance. In truth, the Library inclu<span class="variation1">d</span>es all verbal structures, all variations permitte<span class="variation1">d</span> by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons un<span class="variation1">d</span>er my a<span class="variation1">d</span>ministration is entitle<span class="variation1">d</span> The Combe<span class="variation1">d</span> Thun<span class="variation1">d</span>erclap an<span class="variation1">d</span> another The Plaster Cramp an<span class="variation1">d</span> another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no <span class="variation1">d</span>oubt be justifie<span class="variation1">d</span> in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal an<span class="variation1">d</span>, ex hypothesi, alrea<span class="variation1">d</span>y figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation1">d</span>hcmrlcht<span class="variation1">d</span>j
      <br><br>
      which the <span class="variation1">d</span>ivine Library has not foreseen an<span class="variation1">d</span> which in one of its secret tongues <span class="variation1">d</span>o not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not fille<span class="variation1">d</span> with ten<span class="variation1">d</span>erness an<span class="variation1">d</span> fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a go<span class="variation1">d</span>. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wor<span class="variation1">d</span>y an<span class="variation1">d</span> useless epistle alrea<span class="variation1">d</span>y exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - an<span class="variation1">d</span> its refutation as well. (An n number of possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct <span class="variation1">d</span>efinition a ubiquitous an<span class="variation1">d</span> lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is brea<span class="variation1">d</span> or pyrami<span class="variation1">d</span> or anything else, an<span class="variation1">d</span> these seven wor<span class="variation1">d</span>s which <span class="variation1">d</span>efine it have another value. You who rea<span class="variation1">d</span> me, are You sure of un<span class="variation1">d</span>erstan<span class="variation1">d</span>ing my language?)
      <br><br>
      The metho<span class="variation1">d</span>ical task of writing <span class="variation1">d</span>istracts me from the present state of men. The certitu<span class="variation1">d</span>e that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of <span class="variation1">d</span>istricts in which the young men prostrate themselves before books an<span class="variation1">d</span> kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they <span class="variation1">d</span>o not know how to <span class="variation1">d</span>ecipher a single letter. Epi<span class="variation1">d</span>emics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably <span class="variation1">d</span>egenerate into ban<span class="variation1">d</span>itry, have <span class="variation1">d</span>ecimate<span class="variation1">d</span> the population. I believe I have mentione<span class="variation1">d</span> suici<span class="variation1">d</span>es, more an<span class="variation1">d</span> more frequent with the years. Perhaps my ol<span class="variation1">d</span> age an<span class="variation1">d</span> fearfulness <span class="variation1">d</span>eceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguishe<span class="variation1">d</span>, but the Library will en<span class="variation1">d</span>ure: illuminate<span class="variation1">d</span>, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equippe<span class="variation1">d</span> with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.

      I have just written the wor<span class="variation1">d</span> "infinite".' I have not interpolate<span class="variation1">d</span> this a<span class="variation1">d</span>jective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the worl<span class="variation1">d</span> is infinite. Those who ju<span class="variation1">d</span>ge it to be limite<span class="variation1">d</span> postulate that in remote places the corri<span class="variation1">d</span>ors an<span class="variation1">d</span> stairways an<span class="variation1">d</span> hexagons can conceivably come to an en<span class="variation1">d</span> - which is absur<span class="variation1">d</span>. Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books <span class="variation1">d</span>oes have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimite<span class="variation1">d</span> an<span class="variation1">d</span> cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any <span class="variation1">d</span>irection, after centuries he woul<span class="variation1">d</span> see that the same volumes were repeate<span class="variation1">d</span> in the same <span class="variation1">d</span>isor<span class="variation1">d</span>er (which, thus repeate<span class="variation1">d</span>, woul<span class="variation1">d</span> be an or<span class="variation1">d</span>er: the Or<span class="variation1">d</span>er). My solitu<span class="variation1">d</span>e is gla<span class="variation1">d</span><span class="variation1">d</span>ene<span class="variation1">d</span> by this elegant hope 4.

      The original manuscript <span class="variation1">d</span>oes not contain <span class="variation1">d</span>igits or capital letters. The punctuation has been limite<span class="variation1">d</span> to the comma an<span class="variation1">d</span> the perio<span class="variation1">d</span>. These two signs, the space an<span class="variation1">d</span> the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the twenty-five symbols consi<span class="variation1">d</span>ere<span class="variation1">d</span> sufficient by this unknown author. (E<span class="variation1">d</span>itor's note.)

      2. Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suici<span class="variation1">d</span>e an<span class="variation1">d</span> pulmonary <span class="variation1">d</span>iseases have <span class="variation1">d</span>estroye<span class="variation1">d</span> that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have travele<span class="variation1">d</span> for many nights through corri<span class="variation1">d</span>ors an<span class="variation1">d</span> along polishe<span class="variation1">d</span> stairways without fin<span class="variation1">d</span>ing a single librarian.
      <br>
      3. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is exclu<span class="variation1">d</span>e<span class="variation1">d</span>. For example: no book can be a la<span class="variation1">d</span><span class="variation1">d</span>er, although no <span class="variation1">d</span>oubt there are books which <span class="variation1">d</span>iscuss an<span class="variation1">d</span> negate an<span class="variation1">d</span> <span class="variation1">d</span>emonstrate this possibility an<span class="variation1">d</span> others whose structure correspon<span class="variation1">d</span>s to that of a la<span class="variation1">d</span><span class="variation1">d</span>er.

      4. Letizia Alvarez <span class="variation1">d</span>e Tole<span class="variation1">d</span>o has observe<span class="variation1">d</span> that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a single volume woul<span class="variation1">d</span> be sufficient, a volume of or<span class="variation1">d</span>inary format, printe<span class="variation1">d</span> in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri sai<span class="variation1">d</span> that all soli<span class="variation1">d</span> bo<span class="variation1">d</span>ies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The han<span class="variation1">d</span>ling of this silky va<span class="variation1">d</span>e mecum woul<span class="variation1">d</span> not be convenient: each apparent page woul<span class="variation1">d</span> unfol<span class="variation1">d</span> into other analogous ones; the inconceivable mi<span class="variation1">d</span><span class="variation1">d</span>le page woul<span class="variation1">d</span> have no reverse.
