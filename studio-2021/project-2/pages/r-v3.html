      By this a<span class="variation3">r</span>t you may contemplate the va<span class="variation3">r</span>iations of the 23 lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s...
      The Anatomy of Melancholy, pa<span class="variation3">r</span>t 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The unive<span class="variation3">r</span>se (which othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s call the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y) is composed of an indefinite and pe<span class="variation3">r</span>haps infinite numbe<span class="variation3">r</span> of hexagonal galle<span class="variation3">r</span>ies, with vast ai<span class="variation3">r</span> shafts between, su<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ounded by ve<span class="variation3">r</span>y low <span class="variation3">r</span>ailings. F<span class="variation3">r</span>om any of the hexagons one can see, inte<span class="variation3">r</span>minably, the uppe<span class="variation3">r</span> and lowe<span class="variation3">r</span> floo<span class="variation3">r</span>s. The dist<span class="variation3">r</span>ibution of the galle<span class="variation3">r</span>ies is inva<span class="variation3">r</span>iable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves pe<span class="variation3">r</span> side, cove<span class="variation3">r</span> all the sides except two; thei<span class="variation3">r</span> height, which is the distance f<span class="variation3">r</span>om floo<span class="variation3">r</span> to ceiling, sca<span class="variation3">r</span>cely exceeds that of a no<span class="variation3">r</span>mal bookcase. One of the f<span class="variation3">r</span>ee sides leads to a na<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ow hallway which opens onto anothe<span class="variation3">r</span> galle<span class="variation3">r</span>y, identical to the fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st and to all the <span class="variation3">r</span>est. To the left and <span class="variation3">r</span>ight of the hallway the<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e two ve<span class="variation3">r</span>y small closets. In the fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st, one may sleep standing up; in the othe<span class="variation3">r</span>, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also th<span class="variation3">r</span>ough he<span class="variation3">r</span>e passes a spi<span class="variation3">r</span>al stai<span class="variation3">r</span>way, which sinks abysmally and soa<span class="variation3">r</span>s upwa<span class="variation3">r</span>ds to <span class="variation3">r</span>emote distances. In the hallway the<span class="variation3">r</span>e is a mi<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>o<span class="variation3">r</span> which faithfully duplicates all appea<span class="variation3">r</span>ances. Men usually infe<span class="variation3">r</span> f<span class="variation3">r</span>om this mi<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>o<span class="variation3">r</span> that the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is not infinite (if it we<span class="variation3">r</span>e, why this illuso<span class="variation3">r</span>y duplication?); I p<span class="variation3">r</span>efe<span class="variation3">r</span> to d<span class="variation3">r</span>eam that its polished su<span class="variation3">r</span>faces <span class="variation3">r</span>ep<span class="variation3">r</span>esent and p<span class="variation3">r</span>omise the infinite... Light is p<span class="variation3">r</span>ovided by some sphe<span class="variation3">r</span>ical f<span class="variation3">r</span>uit which bea<span class="variation3">r</span> the name of lamps. The<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e two, t<span class="variation3">r</span>ansve<span class="variation3">r</span>sally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y, I have t<span class="variation3">r</span>aveled in my youth; I have wande<span class="variation3">r</span>ed in sea<span class="variation3">r</span>ch of a book, pe<span class="variation3">r</span>haps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can ha<span class="variation3">r</span>dly deciphe<span class="variation3">r</span> what I w<span class="variation3">r</span>ite, I am p<span class="variation3">r</span>epa<span class="variation3">r</span>ing to die just a few leagues f<span class="variation3">r</span>om the hexagon in which I was bo<span class="variation3">r</span>n. Once I am dead, the<span class="variation3">r</span>e will be no lack of pious hands to th<span class="variation3">r</span>ow me ove<span class="variation3">r</span> the <span class="variation3">r</span>ailing; my g<span class="variation3">r</span>ave will be the fathomless ai<span class="variation3">r</span>; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind gene<span class="variation3">r</span>ated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is unending. The idealists a<span class="variation3">r</span>gue that the hexagonal <span class="variation3">r</span>ooms a<span class="variation3">r</span>e a necessa<span class="variation3">r</span>y fo<span class="variation3">r</span>m of absolute space o<span class="variation3">r</span>, at least, of ou<span class="variation3">r</span> intuition of space. They <span class="variation3">r</span>eason that a t<span class="variation3">r</span>iangula<span class="variation3">r</span> o<span class="variation3">r</span> pentagonal <span class="variation3">r</span>oom is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that thei<span class="variation3">r</span> ecstasy <span class="variation3">r</span>eveals to them a ci<span class="variation3">r</span>cula<span class="variation3">r</span> chambe<span class="variation3">r</span> containing a g<span class="variation3">r</span>eat ci<span class="variation3">r</span>cula<span class="variation3">r</span> book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete ci<span class="variation3">r</span>cle of the walls; but thei<span class="variation3">r</span> testimony is suspect; thei<span class="variation3">r</span> wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ds, obscu<span class="variation3">r</span>e. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now fo<span class="variation3">r</span> me to <span class="variation3">r</span>epeat the classic dictum: The Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is a sphe<span class="variation3">r</span>e whose exact cente<span class="variation3">r</span> is any one of its hexagons and whose ci<span class="variation3">r</span>cumfe<span class="variation3">r</span>ence is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      The<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e five shelves fo<span class="variation3">r</span> each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thi<span class="variation3">r</span>ty-five books of unifo<span class="variation3">r</span>m fo<span class="variation3">r</span>mat; each book is of fou<span class="variation3">r</span> hund<span class="variation3">r</span>ed and ten pages; each page, of fo<span class="variation3">r</span>ty lines, each line, of some eighty lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s which a<span class="variation3">r</span>e black in colo<span class="variation3">r</span>. The<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e also lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s on the spine of each book; these lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s do not indicate o<span class="variation3">r</span> p<span class="variation3">r</span>efigu<span class="variation3">r</span>e what the pages will say. I know that this incohe<span class="variation3">r</span>ence at one time seemed myste<span class="variation3">r</span>ious. Befo<span class="variation3">r</span>e summa<span class="variation3">r</span>izing the solution (whose discove<span class="variation3">r</span>y, in spite of its t<span class="variation3">r</span>agic p<span class="variation3">r</span>ojections, is pe<span class="variation3">r</span>haps the capital fact in histo<span class="variation3">r</span>y) I wish to <span class="variation3">r</span>ecall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      Fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st: The Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y exists ab aete<span class="variation3">r</span>no. This t<span class="variation3">r</span>uth, whose immediate co<span class="variation3">r</span>olla<span class="variation3">r</span>y is the futu<span class="variation3">r</span>e ete<span class="variation3">r</span>nity of the wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ld, cannot be placed in doubt by any <span class="variation3">r</span>easonable mind. Man, the impe<span class="variation3">r</span>fect lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>ian, may be the p<span class="variation3">r</span>oduct of chance o<span class="variation3">r</span> of malevolent demiu<span class="variation3">r</span>gi; the unive<span class="variation3">r</span>se, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stai<span class="variation3">r</span>ways fo<span class="variation3">r</span> the t<span class="variation3">r</span>avele<span class="variation3">r</span> and lat<span class="variation3">r</span>ines fo<span class="variation3">r</span> the seated lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>ian, can only be the wo<span class="variation3">r</span>k of a god. To pe<span class="variation3">r</span>ceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compa<span class="variation3">r</span>e these c<span class="variation3">r</span>ude wave<span class="variation3">r</span>ing symbols which my fallible hand sc<span class="variation3">r</span>awls on the cove<span class="variation3">r</span> of a book, with the o<span class="variation3">r</span>ganic lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s inside: punctual, delicate, pe<span class="variation3">r</span>fectly black, inimitably symmet<span class="variation3">r</span>ical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The o<span class="variation3">r</span>thog<span class="variation3">r</span>aphical symbols a<span class="variation3">r</span>e twenty-five in numbe<span class="variation3">r</span>. ^ This finding made it possible, th<span class="variation3">r</span>ee hund<span class="variation3">r</span>ed yea<span class="variation3">r</span>s ago, to fo<span class="variation3">r</span>mulate a gene<span class="variation3">r</span>al theo<span class="variation3">r</span>y of the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y and solve satisfacto<span class="variation3">r</span>ily the p<span class="variation3">r</span>oblem which no conjectu<span class="variation3">r</span>e had deciphe<span class="variation3">r</span>ed: the fo<span class="variation3">r</span>mless and chaotic natu<span class="variation3">r</span>e of almost all the books. One which my fathe<span class="variation3">r</span> saw in a hexagon on ci<span class="variation3">r</span>cuit fifteen ninety-fou<span class="variation3">r</span> was made up of the lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s MCV, pe<span class="variation3">r</span>ve<span class="variation3">r</span>sely <span class="variation3">r</span>epeated f<span class="variation3">r</span>om the fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st line to the last. Anothe<span class="variation3">r</span> (ve<span class="variation3">r</span>y much consulted in this a<span class="variation3">r</span>ea) is a me<span class="variation3">r</span>e laby<span class="variation3">r</span>inth of lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy py<span class="variation3">r</span>amids. This much is al<span class="variation3">r</span>eady known: fo<span class="variation3">r</span> eve<span class="variation3">r</span>y sensible line of st<span class="variation3">r</span>aightfo<span class="variation3">r</span>wa<span class="variation3">r</span>d statement, the<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e leagues of senseless cacophonies, ve<span class="variation3">r</span>bal jumbles and incohe<span class="variation3">r</span>ences. (I know of an uncouth <span class="variation3">r</span>egion whose lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>ians <span class="variation3">r</span>epudiate the vain and supe<span class="variation3">r</span>stitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in d<span class="variation3">r</span>eams o<span class="variation3">r</span> in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that the invento<span class="variation3">r</span>s of this w<span class="variation3">r</span>iting imitated the twenty-five natu<span class="variation3">r</span>al symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not enti<span class="variation3">r</span>ely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      Fo<span class="variation3">r</span> a long time it was believed that these impenet<span class="variation3">r</span>able books co<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>esponded to past o<span class="variation3">r</span> <span class="variation3">r</span>emote languages. It is t<span class="variation3">r</span>ue that the most ancient men, the fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>ians, used a language quite diffe<span class="variation3">r</span>ent f<span class="variation3">r</span>om the one we now speak; it is t<span class="variation3">r</span>ue that a few miles to the <span class="variation3">r</span>ight the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floo<span class="variation3">r</span>s fa<span class="variation3">r</span>the<span class="variation3">r</span> up, it is incomp<span class="variation3">r</span>ehensible. All this, I <span class="variation3">r</span>epeat, is t<span class="variation3">r</span>ue, but fou<span class="variation3">r</span> hund<span class="variation3">r</span>ed and ten pages of inalte<span class="variation3">r</span>able MCV's cannot co<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>espond to any language, no matte<span class="variation3">r</span> how dialectical o<span class="variation3">r</span> <span class="variation3">r</span>udimenta<span class="variation3">r</span>y it may be. Some insinuated that each lette<span class="variation3">r</span> could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the thi<span class="variation3">r</span>d line of page 7 (1) was not the one the same se<span class="variation3">r</span>ies may have in anothe<span class="variation3">r</span> position on anothe<span class="variation3">r</span> page, but this vague thesis did not p<span class="variation3">r</span>evail. Othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s thought of c<span class="variation3">r</span>yptog<span class="variation3">r</span>aphs; gene<span class="variation3">r</span>ally, this conjectu<span class="variation3">r</span>e has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was fo<span class="variation3">r</span>mulated by its o<span class="variation3">r</span>iginato<span class="variation3">r</span>s.
      <br><br>
      Five hund<span class="variation3">r</span>ed yea<span class="variation3">r</span>s ago, the chief of an uppe<span class="variation3">r</span> hexagon (2) came upon a book as confusing as the othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s, but which had nea<span class="variation3">r</span>ly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wande<span class="variation3">r</span>ing decode<span class="variation3">r</span> who told him the lines we<span class="variation3">r</span>e w<span class="variation3">r</span>itten in Po<span class="variation3">r</span>tuguese; othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s said they we<span class="variation3">r</span>e Yiddish. Within a centu<span class="variation3">r</span>y, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Gua<span class="variation3">r</span>ani, with classical A<span class="variation3">r</span>abian inflections. The content was also deciphe<span class="variation3">r</span>ed: some notions of combinative analysis, illust<span class="variation3">r</span>ated with examples of va<span class="variation3">r</span>iations with unlimited <span class="variation3">r</span>epetition. These examples made it possible fo<span class="variation3">r</span> a lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>ian of genius to discove<span class="variation3">r</span> the fundamental law of the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y. This thinke<span class="variation3">r</span> obse<span class="variation3">r</span>ved that all the books, no matte<span class="variation3">r</span> how dive<span class="variation3">r</span>se they might be, a<span class="variation3">r</span>e made up of the same elements: the space, the pe<span class="variation3">r</span>iod, the comma, the twenty-two lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which t<span class="variation3">r</span>avele<span class="variation3">r</span>s have confi<span class="variation3">r</span>med: In the vast Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y the<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e no two identical books. F<span class="variation3">r</span>om these two incont<span class="variation3">r</span>ove<span class="variation3">r</span>tible p<span class="variation3">r</span>emises he deduced that the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is total and that its shelves <span class="variation3">r</span>egiste<span class="variation3">r</span> all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd o<span class="variation3">r</span>thog<span class="variation3">r</span>aphical symbols (a numbe<span class="variation3">r</span> which, though ext<span class="variation3">r</span>emely vast, is not infinite): Eve<span class="variation3">r</span>ything: the minutely detailed histo<span class="variation3">r</span>y of the futu<span class="variation3">r</span>e, the a<span class="variation3">r</span>changels' autobiog<span class="variation3">r</span>aphies, the faithful catalogues of the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonst<span class="variation3">r</span>ation of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonst<span class="variation3">r</span>ation of the fallacy of the t<span class="variation3">r</span>ue catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commenta<span class="variation3">r</span>y on that gospel, the commenta<span class="variation3">r</span>y on the commenta<span class="variation3">r</span>y on that gospel, the t<span class="variation3">r</span>ue sto<span class="variation3">r</span>y of you<span class="variation3">r</span> death, the t<span class="variation3">r</span>anslation of eve<span class="variation3">r</span>y book in all languages, the inte<span class="variation3">r</span>polations of eve<span class="variation3">r</span>y book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was p<span class="variation3">r</span>oclaimed that the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y contained all books, the fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st imp<span class="variation3">r</span>ession was one of ext<span class="variation3">r</span>avagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the maste<span class="variation3">r</span>s of an intact and sec<span class="variation3">r</span>et t<span class="variation3">r</span>easu<span class="variation3">r</span>e. The<span class="variation3">r</span>e was no pe<span class="variation3">r</span>sonal o<span class="variation3">r</span> wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ld p<span class="variation3">r</span>oblem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The unive<span class="variation3">r</span>se was justified, the unive<span class="variation3">r</span>se suddenly usu<span class="variation3">r</span>ped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a g<span class="variation3">r</span>eat deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and p<span class="variation3">r</span>ophecy which vindicated fo<span class="variation3">r</span> all time the acts of eve<span class="variation3">r</span>y man in the unive<span class="variation3">r</span>se and <span class="variation3">r</span>etained p<span class="variation3">r</span>odigious a<span class="variation3">r</span>cana fo<span class="variation3">r</span> his futu<span class="variation3">r</span>e. Thousands of the g<span class="variation3">r</span>eedy abandoned thei<span class="variation3">r</span> sweet native hexagons and <span class="variation3">r</span>ushed up the stai<span class="variation3">r</span>ways, u<span class="variation3">r</span>ged on by the vain intention of finding thei<span class="variation3">r</span> Vindication. These pilg<span class="variation3">r</span>ims disputed in the na<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ow co<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ido<span class="variation3">r</span>s, p<span class="variation3">r</span>ofe<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ed da<span class="variation3">r</span>k cu<span class="variation3">r</span>ses, st<span class="variation3">r</span>angled each othe<span class="variation3">r</span> on the divine stai<span class="variation3">r</span>ways, flung the deceptive books into the ai<span class="variation3">r</span> shafts, met thei<span class="variation3">r</span> death cast down in a simila<span class="variation3">r</span> fashion by the inhabitants of <span class="variation3">r</span>emote <span class="variation3">r</span>egions. Othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which <span class="variation3">r</span>efe<span class="variation3">r</span> to pe<span class="variation3">r</span>sons of the futu<span class="variation3">r</span>e, to pe<span class="variation3">r</span>sons who a<span class="variation3">r</span>e pe<span class="variation3">r</span>haps not imagina<span class="variation3">r</span>y) but the sea<span class="variation3">r</span>che<span class="variation3">r</span>s did not <span class="variation3">r</span>emembe<span class="variation3">r</span> that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, o<span class="variation3">r</span> some t<span class="variation3">r</span>eache<span class="variation3">r</span>ous va<span class="variation3">r</span>iation the<span class="variation3">r</span>eof, can be computed as ze<span class="variation3">r</span>o.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a cla<span class="variation3">r</span>ification of humanity's basic myste<span class="variation3">r</span>ies - the o<span class="variation3">r</span>igin of the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y and of time - might be found. It is ve<span class="variation3">r</span>isimila<span class="variation3">r</span> that these g<span class="variation3">r</span>ave myste<span class="variation3">r</span>ies could be explained in wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ds: if the language of philosophe<span class="variation3">r</span>s is not sufficient, the multifo<span class="variation3">r</span>m Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y will have p<span class="variation3">r</span>oduced the unp<span class="variation3">r</span>ecedented language <span class="variation3">r</span>equi<span class="variation3">r</span>ed, with its vocabula<span class="variation3">r</span>ies and g<span class="variation3">r</span>amma<span class="variation3">r</span>s. Fo<span class="variation3">r</span> fou<span class="variation3">r</span> centu<span class="variation3">r</span>ies now men have exhausted the hexagons... The<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e official sea<span class="variation3">r</span>che<span class="variation3">r</span>s, inquisito<span class="variation3">r</span>s. I have seen them in the pe<span class="variation3">r</span>fo<span class="variation3">r</span>mance of thei<span class="variation3">r</span> function: they always a<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ive ext<span class="variation3">r</span>emely ti<span class="variation3">r</span>ed f<span class="variation3">r</span>om thei<span class="variation3">r</span> jou<span class="variation3">r</span>neys; they speak of a b<span class="variation3">r</span>oken stai<span class="variation3">r</span>way which almost killed them; they talk with the lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>ian of galle<span class="variation3">r</span>ies and stai<span class="variation3">r</span>s; sometimes they pick up the nea<span class="variation3">r</span>est volume and leaf th<span class="variation3">r</span>ough it, looking fo<span class="variation3">r</span> infamous wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ds. Obviously, no one expects to discove<span class="variation3">r</span> anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natu<span class="variation3">r</span>al, this ino<span class="variation3">r</span>dinate hope was followed by an excessive dep<span class="variation3">r</span>ession. The ce<span class="variation3">r</span>titude that some shelf in some hexagon held p<span class="variation3">r</span>ecious books and that these p<span class="variation3">r</span>ecious books we<span class="variation3">r</span>e inaccessible, seemed almost intole<span class="variation3">r</span>able. A blasphemous sect suggested that the sea<span class="variation3">r</span>ches should cease and that all men should juggle lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s and symbols until they const<span class="variation3">r</span>ucted, by an imp<span class="variation3">r</span>obable gift of chance, these canonical books. The autho<span class="variation3">r</span>ities we<span class="variation3">r</span>e obliged to issue seve<span class="variation3">r</span>e o<span class="variation3">r</span>de<span class="variation3">r</span>s. The sect disappea<span class="variation3">r</span>ed, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, fo<span class="variation3">r</span> long pe<span class="variation3">r</span>iods of time, would hide in the lat<span class="variation3">r</span>ines with some metal disks in a fo<span class="variation3">r</span>bidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine diso<span class="variation3">r</span>de<span class="variation3">r</span>.
      <br><br>
      Othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s, inve<span class="variation3">r</span>sely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ks. They invaded the hexagons, showed c<span class="variation3">r</span>edentials which we<span class="variation3">r</span>e not always false, leafed th<span class="variation3">r</span>ough a volume with displeasu<span class="variation3">r</span>e and condemned whole shelves: thei<span class="variation3">r</span> hygienic, ascetic fu<span class="variation3">r</span>o<span class="variation3">r</span> caused the senseless pe<span class="variation3">r</span>dition of millions of books. Thei<span class="variation3">r</span> name is exec<span class="variation3">r</span>ated, but those who deplo<span class="variation3">r</span>e the "t<span class="variation3">r</span>easu<span class="variation3">r</span>es" dest<span class="variation3">r</span>oyed by this f<span class="variation3">r</span>enzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is so eno<span class="variation3">r</span>mous that any <span class="variation3">r</span>eduction of human o<span class="variation3">r</span>igin is infinitesimal. The othe<span class="variation3">r</span>: eve<span class="variation3">r</span>y copy is unique, i<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>eplaceable, but (since the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is total) the<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e always seve<span class="variation3">r</span>al hund<span class="variation3">r</span>ed thousand impe<span class="variation3">r</span>fect facsimiles: wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ks which diffe<span class="variation3">r</span> only in a lette<span class="variation3">r</span> o<span class="variation3">r</span> a comma. Counte<span class="variation3">r</span> to gene<span class="variation3">r</span>al opinion, I ventu<span class="variation3">r</span>e to suppose that the consequences of the Pu<span class="variation3">r</span>ifie<span class="variation3">r</span>s' dep<span class="variation3">r</span>edations have been exagge<span class="variation3">r</span>ated by the ho<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>o<span class="variation3">r</span> these fanatics p<span class="variation3">r</span>oduced. They we<span class="variation3">r</span>e u<span class="variation3">r</span>ged on by the deli<span class="variation3">r</span>ium of t<span class="variation3">r</span>ying to <span class="variation3">r</span>each the books in the C<span class="variation3">r</span>imson Hexagon: books whose fo<span class="variation3">r</span>mat is smalle<span class="variation3">r</span> than usual, all-powe<span class="variation3">r</span>ful, illust<span class="variation3">r</span>ated and magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of anothe<span class="variation3">r</span> supe<span class="variation3">r</span>stition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men <span class="variation3">r</span>easoned) the<span class="variation3">r</span>e must exist a book which is the fo<span class="variation3">r</span>mula and pe<span class="variation3">r</span>fect compendium of all the <span class="variation3">r</span>est: some lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>ian has gone th<span class="variation3">r</span>ough it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this <span class="variation3">r</span>emote functiona<span class="variation3">r</span>y's cult still pe<span class="variation3">r</span>sist. Many wande<span class="variation3">r</span>ed in sea<span class="variation3">r</span>ch of Him. Fo<span class="variation3">r</span> a centu<span class="variation3">r</span>y they have exhausted in vain the most va<span class="variation3">r</span>ied a<span class="variation3">r</span>eas. How could one locate the vene<span class="variation3">r</span>ated and sec<span class="variation3">r</span>et hexagon which housed Him? Someone p<span class="variation3">r</span>oposed a <span class="variation3">r</span>eg<span class="variation3">r</span>essive method: To locate book A, consult fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventu<span class="variation3">r</span>es such as these, I have squande<span class="variation3">r</span>ed and wasted my yea<span class="variation3">r</span>s. It does not seem unlikely to me that the<span class="variation3">r</span>e is a total book on some shelf of the unive<span class="variation3">r</span>se (3) ; I p<span class="variation3">r</span>ay to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it we<span class="variation3">r</span>e thousands of yea<span class="variation3">r</span>s ago! - may have examined and <span class="variation3">r</span>ead it. If hono<span class="variation3">r</span> and wisdom and happiness a<span class="variation3">r</span>e not fo<span class="variation3">r</span> me, let them be fo<span class="variation3">r</span> othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be out<span class="variation3">r</span>aged and annihilated, but fo<span class="variation3">r</span> one instant, in one being, let You<span class="variation3">r</span> eno<span class="variation3">r</span>mous Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is no<span class="variation3">r</span>mal in the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y and that the <span class="variation3">r</span>easonable (and even humble and pu<span class="variation3">r</span>e cohe<span class="variation3">r</span>ence) is an almost mi<span class="variation3">r</span>aculous exception. They speak (I know) of the "feve<span class="variation3">r</span>ish Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y whose chance volumes a<span class="variation3">r</span>e constantly in dange<span class="variation3">r</span> of changing into othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s and affi<span class="variation3">r</span>m, negate and confuse eve<span class="variation3">r</span>ything like a deli<span class="variation3">r</span>ious divinity." These wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ds, which not only denounce the diso<span class="variation3">r</span>de<span class="variation3">r</span> but exemplify it as well, noto<span class="variation3">r</span>iously p<span class="variation3">r</span>ove thei<span class="variation3">r</span> autho<span class="variation3">r</span>s' abominable taste and despe<span class="variation3">r</span>ate igno<span class="variation3">r</span>ance. In t<span class="variation3">r</span>uth, the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y includes all ve<span class="variation3">r</span>bal st<span class="variation3">r</span>uctu<span class="variation3">r</span>es, all va<span class="variation3">r</span>iations pe<span class="variation3">r</span>mitted by the twenty-five o<span class="variation3">r</span>thog<span class="variation3">r</span>aphical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to obse<span class="variation3">r</span>ve that the best volume of the many hexagons unde<span class="variation3">r</span> my administ<span class="variation3">r</span>ation is entitled The Combed Thunde<span class="variation3">r</span>clap and anothe<span class="variation3">r</span> The Plaste<span class="variation3">r</span> C<span class="variation3">r</span>amp and anothe<span class="variation3">r</span> Axaxaxas mlo. These ph<span class="variation3">r</span>ases, at fi<span class="variation3">r</span>st glance incohe<span class="variation3">r</span>ent, can no doubt be justified in a c<span class="variation3">r</span>yptog<span class="variation3">r</span>aphical o<span class="variation3">r</span> allego<span class="variation3">r</span>ical manne<span class="variation3">r</span>; such a justification is ve<span class="variation3">r</span>bal and, ex hypothesi, al<span class="variation3">r</span>eady figu<span class="variation3">r</span>es in the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y. I cannot combine some cha<span class="variation3">r</span>acte<span class="variation3">r</span>s

      which the divine Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y has not fo<span class="variation3">r</span>eseen and which in one of its sec<span class="variation3">r</span>et tongues do not contain a te<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ible meaning. No one can a<span class="variation3">r</span>ticulate a syllable which is not filled with tende<span class="variation3">r</span>ness and fea<span class="variation3">r</span>, which is not, in one of these languages, the powe<span class="variation3">r</span>ful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wo<span class="variation3">r</span>dy and useless epistle al<span class="variation3">r</span>eady exists in one of the thi<span class="variation3">r</span>ty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innume<span class="variation3">r</span>able hexagons - and its <span class="variation3">r</span>efutation as well. (An n numbe<span class="variation3">r</span> of possible languages use the same vocabula<span class="variation3">r</span>y; in some of them, the symbol lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y allows the co<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ect definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galle<span class="variation3">r</span>ies, but lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is b<span class="variation3">r</span>ead o<span class="variation3">r</span> py<span class="variation3">r</span>amid o<span class="variation3">r</span> anything else, and these seven wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ds which define it have anothe<span class="variation3">r</span> value. You who <span class="variation3">r</span>ead me, a<span class="variation3">r</span>e You su<span class="variation3">r</span>e of unde<span class="variation3">r</span>standing my language?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of w<span class="variation3">r</span>iting dist<span class="variation3">r</span>acts me f<span class="variation3">r</span>om the p<span class="variation3">r</span>esent state of men. The ce<span class="variation3">r</span>titude that eve<span class="variation3">r</span>ything has been w<span class="variation3">r</span>itten negates us o<span class="variation3">r</span> tu<span class="variation3">r</span>ns us into phantoms. I know of dist<span class="variation3">r</span>icts in which the young men p<span class="variation3">r</span>ost<span class="variation3">r</span>ate themselves befo<span class="variation3">r</span>e books and kiss thei<span class="variation3">r</span> pages in a ba<span class="variation3">r</span>ba<span class="variation3">r</span>ous manne<span class="variation3">r</span>, but they do not know how to deciphe<span class="variation3">r</span> a single lette<span class="variation3">r</span>. Epidemics, he<span class="variation3">r</span>etical conflicts, pe<span class="variation3">r</span>eg<span class="variation3">r</span>inations which inevitably degene<span class="variation3">r</span>ate into bandit<span class="variation3">r</span>y, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, mo<span class="variation3">r</span>e and mo<span class="variation3">r</span>e f<span class="variation3">r</span>equent with the yea<span class="variation3">r</span>s. Pe<span class="variation3">r</span>haps my old age and fea<span class="variation3">r</span>fulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y will endu<span class="variation3">r</span>e: illuminated, solita<span class="variation3">r</span>y, infinite, pe<span class="variation3">r</span>fectly motionless, equipped with p<span class="variation3">r</span>ecious volumes, useless, inco<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>uptible, sec<span class="variation3">r</span>et.
      <br><br>
      I have just w<span class="variation3">r</span>itten the wo<span class="variation3">r</span>d "infinite".' I have not inte<span class="variation3">r</span>polated this adjective out of <span class="variation3">r</span>heto<span class="variation3">r</span>ical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the wo<span class="variation3">r</span>ld is infinite. Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in <span class="variation3">r</span>emote places the co<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ido<span class="variation3">r</span>s and stai<span class="variation3">r</span>ways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absu<span class="variation3">r</span>d. Those who imagine it to be without limit fo<span class="variation3">r</span>get that the possible numbe<span class="variation3">r</span> of books does have such a limit. I ventu<span class="variation3">r</span>e to suggest this solution to the ancient p<span class="variation3">r</span>oblem: The Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is unlimited and cyclical. If an ete<span class="variation3">r</span>nal t<span class="variation3">r</span>avele<span class="variation3">r</span> we<span class="variation3">r</span>e to c<span class="variation3">r</span>oss it in any di<span class="variation3">r</span>ection, afte<span class="variation3">r</span> centu<span class="variation3">r</span>ies he would see that the same volumes we<span class="variation3">r</span>e <span class="variation3">r</span>epeated in the same diso<span class="variation3">r</span>de<span class="variation3">r</span> (which, thus <span class="variation3">r</span>epeated, would be an o<span class="variation3">r</span>de<span class="variation3">r</span>: the O<span class="variation3">r</span>de<span class="variation3">r</span>). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope (4).

      1. The o<span class="variation3">r</span>iginal manusc<span class="variation3">r</span>ipt does not contain digits o<span class="variation3">r</span> capital lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s. The punctuation has been limited to the comma and the pe<span class="variation3">r</span>iod. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two lette<span class="variation3">r</span>s of the alphabet a<span class="variation3">r</span>e the twenty-five symbols conside<span class="variation3">r</span>ed sufficient by this unknown autho<span class="variation3">r</span>.

A memo<span class="variation3">r</span>y of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have t<span class="variation3">r</span>aveled fo<span class="variation3">r</span> many nights th<span class="variation3">r</span>ough co<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>ido<span class="variation3">r</span>s and along polished stai<span class="variation3">r</span>ways without finding a single lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>ian.
      <br><br>
      3. I <span class="variation3">r</span>epeat: it suffices that a book be possible fo<span class="variation3">r</span> it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. Fo<span class="variation3">r</span> example: no book can be a ladde<span class="variation3">r</span>, although no doubt the<span class="variation3">r</span>e a<span class="variation3">r</span>e books which discuss and negate and demonst<span class="variation3">r</span>ate this possibility and othe<span class="variation3">r</span>s whose st<span class="variation3">r</span>uctu<span class="variation3">r</span>e co<span class="variation3">r</span><span class="variation3">r</span>esponds to that of a ladde<span class="variation3">r</span>.

      4. Letizia Alva<span class="variation3">r</span>ez de Toledo has obse<span class="variation3">r</span>ved that this vast Lib<span class="variation3">r</span>a<span class="variation3">r</span>y is useless: <span class="variation3">r</span>igo<span class="variation3">r</span>ously speaking, a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of o<span class="variation3">r</span>dina<span class="variation3">r</span>y fo<span class="variation3">r</span>mat, p<span class="variation3">r</span>inted in nine o<span class="variation3">r</span> ten point type, containing an infinite numbe<span class="variation3">r</span> if infinitely thin leaves. (In the ea<span class="variation3">r</span>ly seventeenth centu<span class="variation3">r</span>y, Cavalie<span class="variation3">r</span>i said that all solid bodies a<span class="variation3">r</span>e the supe<span class="variation3">r</span>imposition of an infinite numbe<span class="variation3">r</span> of planes.) The handling of this silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each appa<span class="variation3">r</span>ent page would unfold into othe<span class="variation3">r</span> analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no <span class="variation3">r</span>eve<span class="variation3">r</span>se.
