      The universe (which others c<span class="variation1">a</span>ll the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry) is composed of <span class="variation1">a</span>n indefinite <span class="variation1">a</span>nd perh<span class="variation1">a</span>ps infinite number of hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gon<span class="variation1">a</span>l g<span class="variation1">a</span>lleries, with v<span class="variation1">a</span>st <span class="variation1">a</span>ir sh<span class="variation1">a</span>fts between, surrounded by very low r<span class="variation1">a</span>ilings. From <span class="variation1">a</span>ny of the hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gons one c<span class="variation1">a</span>n see, intermin<span class="variation1">a</span>bly, the upper <span class="variation1">a</span>nd lower floors. The distribution of the g<span class="variation1">a</span>lleries is inv<span class="variation1">a</span>ri<span class="variation1">a</span>ble. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover <span class="variation1">a</span>ll the sides except two; their height, which is the dist<span class="variation1">a</span>nce from floor to ceiling, sc<span class="variation1">a</span>rcely exceeds th<span class="variation1">a</span>t of <span class="variation1">a</span> norm<span class="variation1">a</span>l bookc<span class="variation1">a</span>se. One of the free sides le<span class="variation1">a</span>ds to <span class="variation1">a</span> n<span class="variation1">a</span>rrow h<span class="variation1">a</span>llw<span class="variation1">a</span>y which opens onto <span class="variation1">a</span>nother g<span class="variation1">a</span>llery, identic<span class="variation1">a</span>l to the first <span class="variation1">a</span>nd to <span class="variation1">a</span>ll the rest. To the left <span class="variation1">a</span>nd right of the h<span class="variation1">a</span>llw<span class="variation1">a</span>y there <span class="variation1">a</span>re two very sm<span class="variation1">a</span>ll closets. In the first, one m<span class="variation1">a</span>y sleep st<span class="variation1">a</span>nding up; in the other, s<span class="variation1">a</span>tisfy one's fec<span class="variation1">a</span>l necessities. <span class="variation1">A</span>lso through here p<span class="variation1">a</span>sses <span class="variation1">a</span> spir<span class="variation1">a</span>l st<span class="variation1">a</span>irw<span class="variation1">a</span>y, which sinks <span class="variation1">a</span>bysm<span class="variation1">a</span>lly <span class="variation1">a</span>nd so<span class="variation1">a</span>rs upw<span class="variation1">a</span>rds to remote dist<span class="variation1">a</span>nces. In the h<span class="variation1">a</span>llw<span class="variation1">a</span>y there is <span class="variation1">a</span> mirror which f<span class="variation1">a</span>ithfully duplic<span class="variation1">a</span>tes <span class="variation1">a</span>ll <span class="variation1">a</span>ppe<span class="variation1">a</span>r<span class="variation1">a</span>nces. Men usu<span class="variation1">a</span>lly infer from this mirror th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplic<span class="variation1">a</span>tion?); I prefer to dre<span class="variation1">a</span>m th<span class="variation1">a</span>t its polished surf<span class="variation1">a</span>ces represent <span class="variation1">a</span>nd promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spheric<span class="variation1">a</span>l fruit which be<span class="variation1">a</span>r the n<span class="variation1">a</span>me of l<span class="variation1">a</span>mps. There <span class="variation1">a</span>re two, tr<span class="variation1">a</span>nsvers<span class="variation1">a</span>lly pl<span class="variation1">a</span>ced, in e<span class="variation1">a</span>ch hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gon. The light they emit is insufficient, incess<span class="variation1">a</span>nt.
      <br><br>
      Like <span class="variation1">a</span>ll men of the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry, I h<span class="variation1">a</span>ve tr<span class="variation1">a</span>veled in my youth; I h<span class="variation1">a</span>ve w<span class="variation1">a</span>ndered in se<span class="variation1">a</span>rch of <span class="variation1">a</span> book, perh<span class="variation1">a</span>ps the c<span class="variation1">a</span>t<span class="variation1">a</span>logue of c<span class="variation1">a</span>t<span class="variation1">a</span>logues; now th<span class="variation1">a</span>t my eyes c<span class="variation1">a</span>n h<span class="variation1">a</span>rdly decipher wh<span class="variation1">a</span>t I write, I <span class="variation1">a</span>m prep<span class="variation1">a</span>ring to die just <span class="variation1">a</span> few le<span class="variation1">a</span>gues from the hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gon in which I w<span class="variation1">a</span>s born. Once I <span class="variation1">a</span>m de<span class="variation1">a</span>d, there will be no l<span class="variation1">a</span>ck of pious h<span class="variation1">a</span>nds to throw me over the r<span class="variation1">a</span>iling; my gr<span class="variation1">a</span>ve will be the f<span class="variation1">a</span>thomless <span class="variation1">a</span>ir; my body will sink endlessly <span class="variation1">a</span>nd dec<span class="variation1">a</span>y <span class="variation1">a</span>nd dissolve in the wind gener<span class="variation1">a</span>ted by the f<span class="variation1">a</span>ll, which is infinite. I s<span class="variation1">a</span>y th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry is unending. The ide<span class="variation1">a</span>lists <span class="variation1">a</span>rgue th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gon<span class="variation1">a</span>l rooms <span class="variation1">a</span>re <span class="variation1">a</span> necess<span class="variation1">a</span>ry form of <span class="variation1">a</span>bsolute sp<span class="variation1">a</span>ce or, <span class="variation1">a</span>t le<span class="variation1">a</span>st, of our intuition of sp<span class="variation1">a</span>ce. They re<span class="variation1">a</span>son th<span class="variation1">a</span>t <span class="variation1">a</span> tri<span class="variation1">a</span>ngul<span class="variation1">a</span>r or pent<span class="variation1">a</span>gon<span class="variation1">a</span>l room is inconceiv<span class="variation1">a</span>ble. (The mystics cl<span class="variation1">a</span>im th<span class="variation1">a</span>t their ecst<span class="variation1">a</span>sy reve<span class="variation1">a</span>ls to them <span class="variation1">a</span> circul<span class="variation1">a</span>r ch<span class="variation1">a</span>mber cont<span class="variation1">a</span>ining <span class="variation1">a</span> gre<span class="variation1">a</span>t circul<span class="variation1">a</span>r book, whose spine is continuous <span class="variation1">a</span>nd which follows the complete circle of the w<span class="variation1">a</span>lls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclic<span class="variation1">a</span>l book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repe<span class="variation1">a</span>t the cl<span class="variation1">a</span>ssic dictum: The Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry is <span class="variation1">a</span> sphere whose ex<span class="variation1">a</span>ct center is <span class="variation1">a</span>ny one of its hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gons <span class="variation1">a</span>nd whose circumference is in<span class="variation1">a</span>ccessible.
      <br><br>
      There <span class="variation1">a</span>re five shelves for e<span class="variation1">a</span>ch of the hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gon's w<span class="variation1">a</span>lls; e<span class="variation1">a</span>ch shelf cont<span class="variation1">a</span>ins thirty-five books of uniform form<span class="variation1">a</span>t; e<span class="variation1">a</span>ch book is of four hundred <span class="variation1">a</span>nd ten p<span class="variation1">a</span>ges; e<span class="variation1">a</span>ch p<span class="variation1">a</span>ge, of forty lines, e<span class="variation1">a</span>ch line, of some eighty letters which <span class="variation1">a</span>re bl<span class="variation1">a</span>ck in color. There <span class="variation1">a</span>re <span class="variation1">a</span>lso letters on the spine of e<span class="variation1">a</span>ch book; these letters do not indic<span class="variation1">a</span>te or prefigure wh<span class="variation1">a</span>t the p<span class="variation1">a</span>ges will s<span class="variation1">a</span>y. I know th<span class="variation1">a</span>t this incoherence <span class="variation1">a</span>t one time seemed mysterious. Before summ<span class="variation1">a</span>rizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tr<span class="variation1">a</span>gic projections, is perh<span class="variation1">a</span>ps the c<span class="variation1">a</span>pit<span class="variation1">a</span>l f<span class="variation1">a</span>ct in history) I wish to rec<span class="variation1">a</span>ll <span class="variation1">a</span> few <span class="variation1">a</span>xioms.
      <br><br>
      <!-- bre<span class="variation1">a</span>k -->
      First: The Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry exists <span class="variation1">a</span>b <span class="variation1">a</span>eterno. This truth, whose immedi<span class="variation1">a</span>te coroll<span class="variation1">a</span>ry is the future eternity of the world, c<span class="variation1">a</span>nnot be pl<span class="variation1">a</span>ced in doubt by <span class="variation1">a</span>ny re<span class="variation1">a</span>son<span class="variation1">a</span>ble mind. M<span class="variation1">a</span>n, the imperfect libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ri<span class="variation1">a</span>n, m<span class="variation1">a</span>y be the product of ch<span class="variation1">a</span>nce or of m<span class="variation1">a</span>levolent demiurgi; the universe, with its eleg<span class="variation1">a</span>nt endowment of shelves, of enigm<span class="variation1">a</span>tic<span class="variation1">a</span>l volumes, of inexh<span class="variation1">a</span>ustible st<span class="variation1">a</span>irw<span class="variation1">a</span>ys for the tr<span class="variation1">a</span>veler <span class="variation1">a</span>nd l<span class="variation1">a</span>trines for the se<span class="variation1">a</span>ted libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ri<span class="variation1">a</span>n, c<span class="variation1">a</span>n only be the work of <span class="variation1">a</span> god. To perceive the dist<span class="variation1">a</span>nce between the divine <span class="variation1">a</span>nd the hum<span class="variation1">a</span>n, it is enough to comp<span class="variation1">a</span>re these crude w<span class="variation1">a</span>vering symbols which my f<span class="variation1">a</span>llible h<span class="variation1">a</span>nd scr<span class="variation1">a</span>wls on the cover of <span class="variation1">a</span> book, with the org<span class="variation1">a</span>nic letters inside: punctu<span class="variation1">a</span>l, delic<span class="variation1">a</span>te, perfectly bl<span class="variation1">a</span>ck, inimit<span class="variation1">a</span>bly symmetric<span class="variation1">a</span>l.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthogr<span class="variation1">a</span>phic<span class="variation1">a</span>l symbols <span class="variation1">a</span>re twenty-five in number.^ This finding m<span class="variation1">a</span>de it possible, three hundred ye<span class="variation1">a</span>rs <span class="variation1">a</span>go, to formul<span class="variation1">a</span>te <span class="variation1">a</span> gener<span class="variation1">a</span>l theory of the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry <span class="variation1">a</span>nd solve s<span class="variation1">a</span>tisf<span class="variation1">a</span>ctorily the problem which no conjecture h<span class="variation1">a</span>d deciphered: the formless <span class="variation1">a</span>nd ch<span class="variation1">a</span>otic n<span class="variation1">a</span>ture of <span class="variation1">a</span>lmost <span class="variation1">a</span>ll the books. One which my f<span class="variation1">a</span>ther s<span class="variation1">a</span>w in <span class="variation1">a</span> hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gon on circuit fifteen ninety-four w<span class="variation1">a</span>s m<span class="variation1">a</span>de up of the letters MCV, perversely repe<span class="variation1">a</span>ted from the first line to the l<span class="variation1">a</span>st. <span class="variation1">A</span>nother (very much consulted in this <span class="variation1">a</span>re<span class="variation1">a</span>) is <span class="variation1">a</span> mere l<span class="variation1">a</span>byrinth of letters, but the next-to-l<span class="variation1">a</span>st p<span class="variation1">a</span>ge s<span class="variation1">a</span>ys Oh time thy pyr<span class="variation1">a</span>mids. This much is <span class="variation1">a</span>lre<span class="variation1">a</span>dy known: for every sensible line of str<span class="variation1">a</span>ightforw<span class="variation1">a</span>rd st<span class="variation1">a</span>tement, there <span class="variation1">a</span>re le<span class="variation1">a</span>gues of senseless c<span class="variation1">a</span>cophonies, verb<span class="variation1">a</span>l jumbles <span class="variation1">a</span>nd incoherences. (I know of <span class="variation1">a</span>n uncouth region whose libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ri<span class="variation1">a</span>ns repudi<span class="variation1">a</span>te the v<span class="variation1">a</span>in <span class="variation1">a</span>nd superstitious custom of finding <span class="variation1">a</span> me<span class="variation1">a</span>ning in books <span class="variation1">a</span>nd equ<span class="variation1">a</span>te it with th<span class="variation1">a</span>t of finding <span class="variation1">a</span> me<span class="variation1">a</span>ning in dre<span class="variation1">a</span>ms or in the ch<span class="variation1">a</span>otic lines of one's p<span class="variation1">a</span>lm... They <span class="variation1">a</span>dmit th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the inventors of this writing imit<span class="variation1">a</span>ted the twenty-five n<span class="variation1">a</span>tur<span class="variation1">a</span>l symbols, but m<span class="variation1">a</span>int<span class="variation1">a</span>in th<span class="variation1">a</span>t this <span class="variation1">a</span>pplic<span class="variation1">a</span>tion is <span class="variation1">a</span>ccident<span class="variation1">a</span>l <span class="variation1">a</span>nd th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we sh<span class="variation1">a</span>ll see, is not entirely f<span class="variation1">a</span>ll<span class="variation1">a</span>cious.)
      <br><br>
      For <span class="variation1">a</span> long time it w<span class="variation1">a</span>s believed th<span class="variation1">a</span>t these impenetr<span class="variation1">a</span>ble books corresponded to p<span class="variation1">a</span>st or remote l<span class="variation1">a</span>ngu<span class="variation1">a</span>ges. It is true th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the most <span class="variation1">a</span>ncient men, the first libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ri<span class="variation1">a</span>ns, used <span class="variation1">a</span> l<span class="variation1">a</span>ngu<span class="variation1">a</span>ge quite different from the one we now spe<span class="variation1">a</span>k; it is true th<span class="variation1">a</span>t <span class="variation1">a</span> few miles to the right the tongue is di<span class="variation1">a</span>lectic<span class="variation1">a</span>l <span class="variation1">a</span>nd th<span class="variation1">a</span>t ninety floors f<span class="variation1">a</span>rther up, it is incomprehensible. <span class="variation1">A</span>ll this, I repe<span class="variation1">a</span>t, is true, but four hundred <span class="variation1">a</span>nd ten p<span class="variation1">a</span>ges of in<span class="variation1">a</span>lter<span class="variation1">a</span>ble MCV's c<span class="variation1">a</span>nnot correspond to <span class="variation1">a</span>ny l<span class="variation1">a</span>ngu<span class="variation1">a</span>ge, no m<span class="variation1">a</span>tter how di<span class="variation1">a</span>lectic<span class="variation1">a</span>l or rudiment<span class="variation1">a</span>ry it m<span class="variation1">a</span>y be. Some insinu<span class="variation1">a</span>ted th<span class="variation1">a</span>t e<span class="variation1">a</span>ch letter could influence the following one <span class="variation1">a</span>nd th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the v<span class="variation1">a</span>lue of MCV in the third line of p<span class="variation1">a</span>ge 71 w<span class="variation1">a</span>s not the one the s<span class="variation1">a</span>me series m<span class="variation1">a</span>y h<span class="variation1">a</span>ve in <span class="variation1">a</span>nother position on <span class="variation1">a</span>nother p<span class="variation1">a</span>ge, but this v<span class="variation1">a</span>gue thesis did not prev<span class="variation1">a</span>il. Others thought of cryptogr<span class="variation1">a</span>phs; gener<span class="variation1">a</span>lly, this conjecture h<span class="variation1">a</span>s been <span class="variation1">a</span>ccepted, though not in the sense in which it w<span class="variation1">a</span>s formul<span class="variation1">a</span>ted by its origin<span class="variation1">a</span>tors.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred ye<span class="variation1">a</span>rs <span class="variation1">a</span>go, the chief of <span class="variation1">a</span>n upper hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gon 2 c<span class="variation1">a</span>me upon <span class="variation1">a</span> book <span class="variation1">a</span>s confusing <span class="variation1">a</span>s the others, but which h<span class="variation1">a</span>d ne<span class="variation1">a</span>rly two p<span class="variation1">a</span>ges of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to <span class="variation1">a</span> w<span class="variation1">a</span>ndering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others s<span class="variation1">a</span>id they were Yiddish.

These ex<span class="variation1">a</span>mples m<span class="variation1">a</span>de it possible for <span class="variation1">a</span> libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ri<span class="variation1">a</span>n of genius to discover the fund<span class="variation1">a</span>ment<span class="variation1">a</span>l l<span class="variation1">a</span>w of the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry. This thinker observed th<span class="variation1">a</span>t <span class="variation1">a</span>ll the books, no m<span class="variation1">a</span>tter how diverse they might be, <span class="variation1">a</span>re m<span class="variation1">a</span>de up of the s<span class="variation1">a</span>me elements: the sp<span class="variation1">a</span>ce, the period, the comm<span class="variation1">a</span>, the twenty-two letters of the <span class="variation1">a</span>lph<span class="variation1">a</span>bet. He <span class="variation1">a</span>lso <span class="variation1">a</span>lleged <span class="variation1">a</span> f<span class="variation1">a</span>ct which tr<span class="variation1">a</span>velers h<span class="variation1">a</span>ve confirmed: In the v<span class="variation1">a</span>st Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry there <span class="variation1">a</span>re no two identic<span class="variation1">a</span>l books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry is tot<span class="variation1">a</span>l <span class="variation1">a</span>nd th<span class="variation1">a</span>t its shelves register <span class="variation1">a</span>ll the possible combin<span class="variation1">a</span>tions of the twenty-odd orthogr<span class="variation1">a</span>phic<span class="variation1">a</span>l symbols (<span class="variation1">a</span> number which, though extremely v<span class="variation1">a</span>st, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely det<span class="variation1">a</span>iled history of the future, the <span class="variation1">a</span>rch<span class="variation1">a</span>ngels' <span class="variation1">a</span>utobiogr<span class="variation1">a</span>phies, the f<span class="variation1">a</span>ithful c<span class="variation1">a</span>t<span class="variation1">a</span>logues of the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry, thous<span class="variation1">a</span>nds <span class="variation1">a</span>nd thous<span class="variation1">a</span>nds of f<span class="variation1">a</span>lse c<span class="variation1">a</span>t<span class="variation1">a</span>logues, the demonstr<span class="variation1">a</span>tion of the f<span class="variation1">a</span>ll<span class="variation1">a</span>cy of those c<span class="variation1">a</span>t<span class="variation1">a</span>logues, the demonstr<span class="variation1">a</span>tion of the f<span class="variation1">a</span>ll<span class="variation1">a</span>cy of the true c<span class="variation1">a</span>t<span class="variation1">a</span>logue, the Gnostic gospel of B<span class="variation1">a</span>silides, the comment<span class="variation1">a</span>ry on th<span class="variation1">a</span>t gospel, the comment<span class="variation1">a</span>ry on the comment<span class="variation1">a</span>ry on th<span class="variation1">a</span>t gospel, the true story of your de<span class="variation1">a</span>th, the tr<span class="variation1">a</span>nsl<span class="variation1">a</span>tion of every book in <span class="variation1">a</span>ll l<span class="variation1">a</span>ngu<span class="variation1">a</span>ges, the interpol<span class="variation1">a</span>tions of every book in <span class="variation1">a</span>ll books.

One: the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry is so enormous th<span class="variation1">a</span>t <span class="variation1">a</span>ny reduction of hum<span class="variation1">a</span>n origin is infinitesim<span class="variation1">a</span>l. The other: every copy is unique, irrepl<span class="variation1">a</span>ce<span class="variation1">a</span>ble, but (since the Libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ry is tot<span class="variation1">a</span>l) there <span class="variation1">a</span>re <span class="variation1">a</span>lw<span class="variation1">a</span>ys sever<span class="variation1">a</span>l hundred thous<span class="variation1">a</span>nd imperfect f<span class="variation1">a</span>csimiles: works which differ only in <span class="variation1">a</span> letter or <span class="variation1">a</span> comm<span class="variation1">a</span>. Counter to gener<span class="variation1">a</span>l opinion, I venture to suppose th<span class="variation1">a</span>t the consequences of the Purifiers' depred<span class="variation1">a</span>tions h<span class="variation1">a</span>ve been ex<span class="variation1">a</span>gger<span class="variation1">a</span>ted by the horror these f<span class="variation1">a</span>n<span class="variation1">a</span>tics produced.

      We <span class="variation1">a</span>lso know of <span class="variation1">a</span>nother superstition of th<span class="variation1">a</span>t time: th<span class="variation1">a</span>t of the M<span class="variation1">a</span>n of the Book. On some shelf in some hex<span class="variation1">a</span>gon (men re<span class="variation1">a</span>soned) there must exist <span class="variation1">a</span> book which is the formul<span class="variation1">a</span> <span class="variation1">a</span>nd perfect compendium of <span class="variation1">a</span>ll the rest: some libr<span class="variation1">a</span>ri<span class="variation1">a</span>n h<span class="variation1">a</span>s gone through it <span class="variation1">a</span>nd he is <span class="variation1">a</span>n<span class="variation1">a</span>logous to <span class="variation1">a</span> god.

      I h<span class="variation1">a</span>ve just written the word "infinite".'
