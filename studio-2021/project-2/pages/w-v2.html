      The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (<span class="variation2">w</span>hich others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, <span class="variation2">w</span>ith vast air shafts bet<span class="variation2">w</span>een, surrounded by very lo<span class="variation2">w</span> railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lo<span class="variation2">w</span>er floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. T<span class="variation2">w</span>enty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except t<span class="variation2">w</span>o; their height, <span class="variation2">w</span>hich is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narro<span class="variation2">w</span> hall<span class="variation2">w</span>ay <span class="variation2">w</span>hich opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hall<span class="variation2">w</span>ay there are t<span class="variation2">w</span>o very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stair<span class="variation2">w</span>ay, <span class="variation2">w</span>hich sinks abysmally and soars up<span class="variation2">w</span>ards to remote distances. In the hall<span class="variation2">w</span>ay there is a mirror <span class="variation2">w</span>hich faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it <span class="variation2">w</span>ere, <span class="variation2">w</span>hy this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spherical fruit <span class="variation2">w</span>hich bear the name of lamps. There are t<span class="variation2">w</span>o, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have <span class="variation2">w</span>andered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; no<span class="variation2">w</span> that my eyes can hardly decipher <span class="variation2">w</span>hat I <span class="variation2">w</span>rite, I am preparing to die just a fe<span class="variation2">w</span> leagues from the hexagon in <span class="variation2">w</span>hich I <span class="variation2">w</span>as born. Once I am dead, there <span class="variation2">w</span>ill be no lack of pious hands to thro<span class="variation2">w</span> me over the railing; my grave <span class="variation2">w</span>ill be the fathomless air; my body <span class="variation2">w</span>ill sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the <span class="variation2">w</span>ind generated by the fall, <span class="variation2">w</span>hich is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, <span class="variation2">w</span>hose spine is continuous and <span class="variation2">w</span>hich follo<span class="variation2">w</span>s the complete circle of the <span class="variation2">w</span>alls; but their testimony is suspect; their <span class="variation2">w</span>ords, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice no<span class="variation2">w</span> for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere <span class="variation2">w</span>hose exact center is any one of its hexagons and <span class="variation2">w</span>hose circumference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's <span class="variation2">w</span>alls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters <span class="variation2">w</span>hich are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure <span class="variation2">w</span>hat the pages <span class="variation2">w</span>ill say. I kno<span class="variation2">w</span> that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (<span class="variation2">w</span>hose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I <span class="variation2">w</span>ish to recall a fe<span class="variation2">w</span> axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, <span class="variation2">w</span>hose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the <span class="variation2">w</span>orld, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the universe, <span class="variation2">w</span>ith its elegant endo<span class="variation2">w</span>ment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stair<span class="variation2">w</span>ays for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the <span class="variation2">w</span>ork of a god. To perceive the distance bet<span class="variation2">w</span>een the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude <span class="variation2">w</span>avering symbols <span class="variation2">w</span>hich my fallible hand scra<span class="variation2">w</span>ls on the cover of a book, <span class="variation2">w</span>ith the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthographical symbols are t<span class="variation2">w</span>enty-five in number. ^ This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem <span class="variation2">w</span>hich no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One <span class="variation2">w</span>hich my father sa<span class="variation2">w</span> in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four <span class="variation2">w</span>as made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already kno<span class="variation2">w</span>n: for every sensible line of straightfor<span class="variation2">w</span>ard statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I kno<span class="variation2">w</span> of an uncouth region <span class="variation2">w</span>hose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it <span class="variation2">w</span>ith that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that the inventors of this <span class="variation2">w</span>riting imitated the t<span class="variation2">w</span>enty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, <span class="variation2">w</span>e shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it <span class="variation2">w</span>as believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one <span class="variation2">w</span>e no<span class="variation2">w</span> speak; it is true that a fe<span class="variation2">w</span> miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter ho<span class="variation2">w</span> dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the follo<span class="variation2">w</span>ing one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 7 (1) <span class="variation2">w</span>as not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in <span class="variation2">w</span>hich it <span class="variation2">w</span>as formulated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon (2) came upon a book as confusing as the others, but <span class="variation2">w</span>hich had nearly t<span class="variation2">w</span>o pages of homogeneous lines. He sho<span class="variation2">w</span>ed his find to a <span class="variation2">w</span>andering decoder <span class="variation2">w</span>ho told him the lines <span class="variation2">w</span>ere <span class="variation2">w</span>ritten in Portuguese; others said they <span class="variation2">w</span>ere Yiddish. <span class="variation2">W</span>ithin a century, the language <span class="variation2">w</span>as established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, <span class="variation2">w</span>ith classical Arabian inflections. The content <span class="variation2">w</span>as also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated <span class="variation2">w</span>ith examples of variations <span class="variation2">w</span>ith unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental la<span class="variation2">w</span> of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter ho<span class="variation2">w</span> diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the t<span class="variation2">w</span>enty-t<span class="variation2">w</span>o letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact <span class="variation2">w</span>hich travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no t<span class="variation2">w</span>o identical books. From these t<span class="variation2">w</span>o incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the t<span class="variation2">w</span>enty-odd orthographical symbols (a number <span class="variation2">w</span>hich, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation2">W</span>hen it <span class="variation2">w</span>as proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression <span class="variation2">w</span>as one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There <span class="variation2">w</span>as no personal or <span class="variation2">w</span>orld problem <span class="variation2">w</span>hose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe <span class="variation2">w</span>as justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal <span class="variation2">w</span>as said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy <span class="variation2">w</span>hich vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their s<span class="variation2">w</span>eet native hexagons and rushed up the stair<span class="variation2">w</span>ays, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narro<span class="variation2">w</span> corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stair<span class="variation2">w</span>ays, flung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast do<span class="variation2">w</span>n in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others <span class="variation2">w</span>ent mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen t<span class="variation2">w</span>o <span class="variation2">w</span>hich refer to persons of the future, to persons <span class="variation2">w</span>ho are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it <span class="variation2">w</span>as also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic mysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in <span class="variation2">w</span>ords: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library <span class="variation2">w</span>ill have produced the unprecedented language required, <span class="variation2">w</span>ith its vocabularies and grammars. For four centuries no<span class="variation2">w</span> men have exhausted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they al<span class="variation2">w</span>ays arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stair<span class="variation2">w</span>ay <span class="variation2">w</span>hich almost killed them; they talk <span class="variation2">w</span>ith the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous <span class="variation2">w</span>ords. Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.
      <br><br>
      As <span class="variation2">w</span>as natural, this inordinate hope <span class="variation2">w</span>as follo<span class="variation2">w</span>ed by an excessive depression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books <span class="variation2">w</span>ere inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities <span class="variation2">w</span>ere obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men <span class="variation2">w</span>ho, for long periods of time, <span class="variation2">w</span>ould hide in the latrines <span class="variation2">w</span>ith some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, believed that it <span class="variation2">w</span>as fundamental to eliminate useless <span class="variation2">w</span>orks. They invaded the hexagons, sho<span class="variation2">w</span>ed credentials <span class="variation2">w</span>hich <span class="variation2">w</span>ere not al<span class="variation2">w</span>ays false, leafed through a volume <span class="variation2">w</span>ith displeasure and condemned <span class="variation2">w</span>hole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those <span class="variation2">w</span>ho deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect t<span class="variation2">w</span>o notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are al<span class="variation2">w</span>ays several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: <span class="variation2">w</span>orks <span class="variation2">w</span>hich differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They <span class="variation2">w</span>ere urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books <span class="variation2">w</span>hose format is smaller than usual, all-po<span class="variation2">w</span>erful, illustrated and magical.
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation2">W</span>e also kno<span class="variation2">w</span> of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book <span class="variation2">w</span>hich is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many <span class="variation2">w</span>andered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. Ho<span class="variation2">w</span> could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon <span class="variation2">w</span>hich housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B <span class="variation2">w</span>hich indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and <span class="variation2">w</span>asted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe (3) ; I pray to the unkno<span class="variation2">w</span>n gods that a man - just one, even though it <span class="variation2">w</span>ere thousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and <span class="variation2">w</span>isdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I kno<span class="variation2">w</span>) of the "feverish Library <span class="variation2">w</span>hose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity." These <span class="variation2">w</span>ords, <span class="variation2">w</span>hich not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as <span class="variation2">w</span>ell, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the t<span class="variation2">w</span>enty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters
      <br><br>
      dhcmrlchtdj
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation2">w</span>hich the divine Library has not foreseen and <span class="variation2">w</span>hich in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable <span class="variation2">w</span>hich is not filled <span class="variation2">w</span>ith tenderness and fear, <span class="variation2">w</span>hich is not, in one of these languages, the po<span class="variation2">w</span>erful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This <span class="variation2">w</span>ordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as <span class="variation2">w</span>ell. (An n number of possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allo<span class="variation2">w</span>s the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven <span class="variation2">w</span>ords <span class="variation2">w</span>hich define it have another value. You <span class="variation2">w</span>ho read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of <span class="variation2">w</span>riting distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that everything has been <span class="variation2">w</span>ritten negates us or turns us into phantoms. I kno<span class="variation2">w</span> of districts in <span class="variation2">w</span>hich the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not kno<span class="variation2">w</span> ho<span class="variation2">w</span> to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations <span class="variation2">w</span>hich inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent <span class="variation2">w</span>ith the years. Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library <span class="variation2">w</span>ill endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped <span class="variation2">w</span>ith precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just <span class="variation2">w</span>ritten the <span class="variation2">w</span>ord "infinite".' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the <span class="variation2">w</span>orld is infinite. Those <span class="variation2">w</span>ho judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stair<span class="variation2">w</span>ays and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - <span class="variation2">w</span>hich is absurd. Those <span class="variation2">w</span>ho imagine it to be <span class="variation2">w</span>ithout limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler <span class="variation2">w</span>ere to cross it in any direction, after centuries he <span class="variation2">w</span>ould see that the same volumes <span class="variation2">w</span>ere repeated in the same disorder (<span class="variation2">w</span>hich, thus repeated, <span class="variation2">w</span>ould be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope (4).

      1. The original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation has been limited to the comma and the period. These t<span class="variation2">w</span>o signs, the space and the t<span class="variation2">w</span>enty-t<span class="variation2">w</span>o letters of the alphabet are the t<span class="variation2">w</span>enty-five symbols considered sufficient by this unkno<span class="variation2">w</span>n author. (Editor's note.)
      <br><br>
      2. Before, there <span class="variation2">w</span>as a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for many nights through corridors and along polished stair<span class="variation2">w</span>ays <span class="variation2">w</span>ithout finding a single librarian.
      <br><br>
      3. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books <span class="variation2">w</span>hich discuss and negate and demonstrate this possibility and others <span class="variation2">w</span>hose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.
      <br><br>
      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a single volume <span class="variation2">w</span>ould be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of this silky vade mecum <span class="variation2">w</span>ould not be convenient: each apparent page <span class="variation2">w</span>ould unfold into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page <span class="variation2">w</span>ould have no reverse.
