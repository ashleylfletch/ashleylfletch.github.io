      The Anatomy o<span class="variation3">f</span> Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which others call the Library) is composed o<span class="variation3">f</span> an inde<span class="variation3">f</span>inite and perhaps in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite number o<span class="variation3">f</span> hexagonal galleries, with vast air sha<span class="variation3">f</span>ts between, surrounded by very low railings. <span class="variation3">F</span>rom any o<span class="variation3">f</span> the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower <span class="variation3">f</span>loors. The distribution o<span class="variation3">f</span> the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, <span class="variation3">f</span>ive long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance <span class="variation3">f</span>rom <span class="variation3">f</span>loor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that o<span class="variation3">f</span> a normal bookcase. One o<span class="variation3">f</span> the <span class="variation3">f</span>ree sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the <span class="variation3">f</span>irst and to all the rest. To the le<span class="variation3">f</span>t and right o<span class="variation3">f</span> the hallway there are two very small closets. In the <span class="variation3">f</span>irst, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satis<span class="variation3">f</span>y one's <span class="variation3">f</span>ecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which <span class="variation3">f</span>aith<span class="variation3">f</span>ully duplicates all appearances. Men usually in<span class="variation3">f</span>er <span class="variation3">f</span>rom this mirror that the Library is not in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite (i<span class="variation3">f</span> it were, why this illusory duplication?); I pre<span class="variation3">f</span>er to dream that its polished sur<span class="variation3">f</span>aces represent and promise the in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite... Light is provided by some spherical <span class="variation3">f</span>ruit which bear the name o<span class="variation3">f</span> lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insu<span class="variation3">f</span><span class="variation3">f</span>icient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men o<span class="variation3">f</span> the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search o<span class="variation3">f</span> a book, perhaps the catalogue o<span class="variation3">f</span> catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a <span class="variation3">f</span>ew leagues <span class="variation3">f</span>rom the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack o<span class="variation3">f</span> pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the <span class="variation3">f</span>athomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the <span class="variation3">f</span>all, which is in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary <span class="variation3">f</span>orm o<span class="variation3">f</span> absolute space or, at least, o<span class="variation3">f</span> our intuition o<span class="variation3">f</span> space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which <span class="variation3">f</span>ollows the complete circle o<span class="variation3">f</span> the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it su<span class="variation3">f</span><span class="variation3">f</span>ice now <span class="variation3">f</span>or me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one o<span class="variation3">f</span> its hexagons and whose circum<span class="variation3">f</span>erence is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are <span class="variation3">f</span>ive shelves <span class="variation3">f</span>or each o<span class="variation3">f</span> the hexagon's walls; each shel<span class="variation3">f</span> contains thirty-<span class="variation3">f</span>ive books o<span class="variation3">f</span> uni<span class="variation3">f</span>orm <span class="variation3">f</span>ormat; each book is o<span class="variation3">f</span> <span class="variation3">f</span>our hundred and ten pages; each page, o<span class="variation3">f</span> <span class="variation3">f</span>orty lines, each line, o<span class="variation3">f</span> some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine o<span class="variation3">f</span> each book; these letters do not indicate or pre<span class="variation3">f</span>igure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Be<span class="variation3">f</span>ore summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite o<span class="variation3">f</span> its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital <span class="variation3">f</span>act in history) I wish to recall a <span class="variation3">f</span>ew axioms.
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation3">F</span>irst: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the <span class="variation3">f</span>uture eternity o<span class="variation3">f</span> the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imper<span class="variation3">f</span>ect librarian, may be the product o<span class="variation3">f</span> chance or o<span class="variation3">f</span> malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment o<span class="variation3">f</span> shelves, o<span class="variation3">f</span> enigmatical volumes, o<span class="variation3">f</span> inexhaustible stairways <span class="variation3">f</span>or the traveler and latrines <span class="variation3">f</span>or the seated librarian, can only be the work o<span class="variation3">f</span> a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my <span class="variation3">f</span>allible hand scrawls on the cover o<span class="variation3">f</span> a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, per<span class="variation3">f</span>ectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-<span class="variation3">f</span>ive in number. ^ This <span class="variation3">f</span>inding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to <span class="variation3">f</span>ormulate a general theory o<span class="variation3">f</span> the Library and solve satis<span class="variation3">f</span>actorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the <span class="variation3">f</span>ormless and chaotic nature o<span class="variation3">f</span> almost all the books. One which my <span class="variation3">f</span>ather saw in a hexagon on circuit <span class="variation3">f</span>i<span class="variation3">f</span>teen ninety-<span class="variation3">f</span>our was made up o<span class="variation3">f</span> the letters MCV, perversely repeated <span class="variation3">f</span>rom the <span class="variation3">f</span>irst line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth o<span class="variation3">f</span> letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: <span class="variation3">f</span>or every sensible line o<span class="variation3">f</span> straight<span class="variation3">f</span>orward statement, there are leagues o<span class="variation3">f</span> senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know o<span class="variation3">f</span> an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom o<span class="variation3">f</span> <span class="variation3">f</span>inding a meaning in books and equate it with that o<span class="variation3">f</span> <span class="variation3">f</span>inding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines o<span class="variation3">f</span> one's palm... They admit that the inventors o<span class="variation3">f</span> this writing imitated the twenty-<span class="variation3">f</span>ive natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signi<span class="variation3">f</span>y nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely <span class="variation3">f</span>allacious.)
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation3">F</span>or a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the <span class="variation3">f</span>irst librarians, used a language quite di<span class="variation3">f</span><span class="variation3">f</span>erent <span class="variation3">f</span>rom the one we now speak; it is true that a <span class="variation3">f</span>ew miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety <span class="variation3">f</span>loors <span class="variation3">f</span>arther up, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but <span class="variation3">f</span>our hundred and ten pages o<span class="variation3">f</span> inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could in<span class="variation3">f</span>luence the <span class="variation3">f</span>ollowing one and that the value o<span class="variation3">f</span> MCV in the third line o<span class="variation3">f</span> page 7 (1) was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought o<span class="variation3">f</span> cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was <span class="variation3">f</span>ormulated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation3">F</span>ive hundred years ago, the chie<span class="variation3">f</span> o<span class="variation3">f</span> an upper hexagon (2) came upon a book as con<span class="variation3">f</span>using as the others, but which had nearly two pages o<span class="variation3">f</span> homogeneous lines. He showed his <span class="variation3">f</span>ind to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect o<span class="variation3">f</span> Guarani, with classical Arabian in<span class="variation3">f</span>lections. The content was also deciphered: some notions o<span class="variation3">f</span> combinative analysis, illustrated with examples o<span class="variation3">f</span> variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible <span class="variation3">f</span>or a librarian o<span class="variation3">f</span> genius to discover the <span class="variation3">f</span>undamental law o<span class="variation3">f</span> the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up o<span class="variation3">f</span> the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters o<span class="variation3">f</span> the alphabet. He also alleged a <span class="variation3">f</span>act which travelers have con<span class="variation3">f</span>irmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. <span class="variation3">F</span>rom these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations o<span class="variation3">f</span> the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite): Everything: the minutely detailed history o<span class="variation3">f</span> the <span class="variation3">f</span>uture, the archangels' autobiographies, the <span class="variation3">f</span>aith<span class="variation3">f</span>ul catalogues o<span class="variation3">f</span> the Library, thousands and thousands o<span class="variation3">f</span> <span class="variation3">f</span>alse catalogues, the demonstration o<span class="variation3">f</span> the <span class="variation3">f</span>allacy o<span class="variation3">f</span> those catalogues, the demonstration o<span class="variation3">f</span> the <span class="variation3">f</span>allacy o<span class="variation3">f</span> the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel o<span class="variation3">f</span> Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story o<span class="variation3">f</span> your death, the translation o<span class="variation3">f</span> every book in all languages, the interpolations o<span class="variation3">f</span> every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the <span class="variation3">f</span>irst impression was one o<span class="variation3">f</span> extravagant happiness. All men <span class="variation3">f</span>elt themselves to be the masters o<span class="variation3">f</span> an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justi<span class="variation3">f</span>ied, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions o<span class="variation3">f</span> hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books o<span class="variation3">f</span> apology and prophecy which vindicated <span class="variation3">f</span>or all time the acts o<span class="variation3">f</span> every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana <span class="variation3">f</span>or his <span class="variation3">f</span>uture. Thousands o<span class="variation3">f</span> the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention o<span class="variation3">f</span> <span class="variation3">f</span>inding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, pro<span class="variation3">f</span>erred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, <span class="variation3">f</span>lung the deceptive books into the air sha<span class="variation3">f</span>ts, met their death cast down in a similar <span class="variation3">f</span>ashion by the inhabitants o<span class="variation3">f</span> remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which re<span class="variation3">f</span>er to persons o<span class="variation3">f</span> the <span class="variation3">f</span>uture, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility o<span class="variation3">f</span> a man's <span class="variation3">f</span>inding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereo<span class="variation3">f</span>, can be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a clari<span class="variation3">f</span>ication o<span class="variation3">f</span> humanity's basic mysteries - the origin o<span class="variation3">f</span> the Library and o<span class="variation3">f</span> time - might be <span class="variation3">f</span>ound. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in words: i<span class="variation3">f</span> the language o<span class="variation3">f</span> philosophers is not su<span class="variation3">f</span><span class="variation3">f</span>icient, the multi<span class="variation3">f</span>orm Library will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars. <span class="variation3">F</span>or <span class="variation3">f</span>our centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are o<span class="variation3">f</span><span class="variation3">f</span>icial searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the per<span class="variation3">f</span>ormance o<span class="variation3">f</span> their <span class="variation3">f</span>unction: they always arrive extremely tired <span class="variation3">f</span>rom their journeys; they speak o<span class="variation3">f</span> a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian o<span class="variation3">f</span> galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and lea<span class="variation3">f</span> through it, looking <span class="variation3">f</span>or in<span class="variation3">f</span>amous words. Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inordinate hope was <span class="variation3">f</span>ollowed by an excessive depression. The certitude that some shel<span class="variation3">f</span> in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gi<span class="variation3">f</span>t o<span class="variation3">f</span> chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, <span class="variation3">f</span>or long periods o<span class="variation3">f</span> time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a <span class="variation3">f</span>orbidden dice cup and <span class="variation3">f</span>eebly mimic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, believed that it was <span class="variation3">f</span>undamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always <span class="variation3">f</span>alse, lea<span class="variation3">f</span>ed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic <span class="variation3">f</span>uror caused the senseless perdition o<span class="variation3">f</span> millions o<span class="variation3">f</span> books. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this <span class="variation3">f</span>renzy neglect two notable <span class="variation3">f</span>acts. One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction o<span class="variation3">f</span> human origin is in<span class="variation3">f</span>initesimal. The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand imper<span class="variation3">f</span>ect <span class="variation3">f</span>acsimiles: works which di<span class="variation3">f</span><span class="variation3">f</span>er only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences o<span class="variation3">f</span> the Puri<span class="variation3">f</span>iers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these <span class="variation3">f</span>anatics produced. They were urged on by the delirium o<span class="variation3">f</span> trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose <span class="variation3">f</span>ormat is smaller than usual, all-power<span class="variation3">f</span>ul, illustrated and magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know o<span class="variation3">f</span> another superstition o<span class="variation3">f</span> that time: that o<span class="variation3">f</span> the Man o<span class="variation3">f</span> the Book. On some shel<span class="variation3">f</span> in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the <span class="variation3">f</span>ormula and per<span class="variation3">f</span>ect compendium o<span class="variation3">f</span> all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language o<span class="variation3">f</span> this zone vestiges o<span class="variation3">f</span> this remote <span class="variation3">f</span>unctionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search o<span class="variation3">f</span> Him. <span class="variation3">F</span>or a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult <span class="variation3">f</span>irst book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult <span class="variation3">f</span>irst a book C, and so on to in<span class="variation3">f</span>inity... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shel<span class="variation3">f</span> o<span class="variation3">f</span> the universe (3) ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands o<span class="variation3">f</span> years ago! - may have examined and read it. I<span class="variation3">f</span> honor and wisdom and happiness are not <span class="variation3">f</span>or me, let them be <span class="variation3">f</span>or others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but <span class="variation3">f</span>or one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justi<span class="variation3">f</span>ied. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) o<span class="variation3">f</span> the "<span class="variation3">f</span>everish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger o<span class="variation3">f</span> changing into others and a<span class="variation3">f</span><span class="variation3">f</span>irm, negate and con<span class="variation3">f</span>use everything like a delirious divinity." These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exempli<span class="variation3">f</span>y it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-<span class="variation3">f</span>ive orthographical symbols, but not a single example o<span class="variation3">f</span> absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume o<span class="variation3">f</span> the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at <span class="variation3">f</span>irst glance incoherent, can no doubt be justi<span class="variation3">f</span>ied in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justi<span class="variation3">f</span>ication is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already <span class="variation3">f</span>igures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters
      <br><br>
      dhcmrlchtdj
      <br><br>
      which the divine Library has not <span class="variation3">f</span>oreseen and which in one o<span class="variation3">f</span> its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not <span class="variation3">f</span>illed with tenderness and <span class="variation3">f</span>ear, which is not, in one o<span class="variation3">f</span> these languages, the power<span class="variation3">f</span>ul name o<span class="variation3">f</span> a god. To speak is to <span class="variation3">f</span>all into tautology. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one o<span class="variation3">f</span> the thirty volumes o<span class="variation3">f</span> the <span class="variation3">f</span>ive shelves o<span class="variation3">f</span> one o<span class="variation3">f</span> the innumerable hexagons - and its re<span class="variation3">f</span>utation as well. (An n number o<span class="variation3">f</span> possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some o<span class="variation3">f</span> them, the symbol library allows the correct de<span class="variation3">f</span>inition a ubiquitous and lasting system o<span class="variation3">f</span> hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words which de<span class="variation3">f</span>ine it have another value. You who read me, are You sure o<span class="variation3">f</span> understanding my language?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task o<span class="variation3">f</span> writing distracts me <span class="variation3">f</span>rom the present state o<span class="variation3">f</span> men. The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know o<span class="variation3">f</span> districts in which the young men prostrate themselves be<span class="variation3">f</span>ore books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical con<span class="variation3">f</span>licts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more <span class="variation3">f</span>requent with the years. Perhaps my old age and <span class="variation3">f</span>ear<span class="variation3">f</span>ulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite, per<span class="variation3">f</span>ectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the word "in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite".' I have not interpolated this adjective out o<span class="variation3">f</span> rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite. Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without limit <span class="variation3">f</span>orget that the possible number o<span class="variation3">f</span> books does have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. I<span class="variation3">f</span> an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, a<span class="variation3">f</span>ter centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope (4).

      1. The original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation has been limited to the comma and the period.

      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a single volume would be su<span class="variation3">f</span><span class="variation3">f</span>icient, a volume o<span class="variation3">f</span> ordinary <span class="variation3">f</span>ormat, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite number i<span class="variation3">f</span> in<span class="variation3">f</span>initely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition o<span class="variation3">f</span> an in<span class="variation3">f</span>inite number o<span class="variation3">f</span> planes.) The handling o<span class="variation3">f</span> this silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would un<span class="variation3">f</span>old into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.
