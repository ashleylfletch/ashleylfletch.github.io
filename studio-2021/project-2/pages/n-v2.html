      The A<span class="variation2">n</span>atomy of Mela<span class="variation2">n</span>choly, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The u<span class="variation2">n</span>iverse (which others call the Library) is composed of a<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span>defi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite a<span class="variation2">n</span>d perhaps i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite <span class="variation2">n</span>umber of hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>al galleries, with vast air shafts betwee<span class="variation2">n</span>, surrou<span class="variation2">n</span>ded by very low raili<span class="variation2">n</span>gs. From a<span class="variation2">n</span>y of the hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s o<span class="variation2">n</span>e ca<span class="variation2">n</span> see, i<span class="variation2">n</span>termi<span class="variation2">n</span>ably, the upper a<span class="variation2">n</span>d lower floors. The distributio<span class="variation2">n</span> of the galleries is i<span class="variation2">n</span>variable. Twe<span class="variation2">n</span>ty shelves, five lo<span class="variation2">n</span>g shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the dista<span class="variation2">n</span>ce from floor to ceili<span class="variation2">n</span>g, scarcely exceeds that of a <span class="variation2">n</span>ormal bookcase. O<span class="variation2">n</span>e of the free sides leads to a <span class="variation2">n</span>arrow hallway which ope<span class="variation2">n</span>s o<span class="variation2">n</span>to a<span class="variation2">n</span>other gallery, ide<span class="variation2">n</span>tical to the first a<span class="variation2">n</span>d to all the rest. To the left a<span class="variation2">n</span>d right of the hallway there are two very small closets. I<span class="variation2">n</span> the first, o<span class="variation2">n</span>e may sleep sta<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g up; i<span class="variation2">n</span> the other, satisfy o<span class="variation2">n</span>e's fecal <span class="variation2">n</span>ecessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which si<span class="variation2">n</span>ks abysmally a<span class="variation2">n</span>d soars upwards to remote dista<span class="variation2">n</span>ces. I<span class="variation2">n</span> the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appeara<span class="variation2">n</span>ces. Me<span class="variation2">n</span> usually i<span class="variation2">n</span>fer from this mirror that the Library is <span class="variation2">n</span>ot i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite (if it were, why this illusory duplicatio<span class="variation2">n</span>?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represe<span class="variation2">n</span>t a<span class="variation2">n</span>d promise the i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite... Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the <span class="variation2">n</span>ame of lamps. There are two, tra<span class="variation2">n</span>sversally placed, i<span class="variation2">n</span> each hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>. The light they emit is i<span class="variation2">n</span>sufficie<span class="variation2">n</span>t, i<span class="variation2">n</span>cessa<span class="variation2">n</span>t.
      <br><br>
      Like all me<span class="variation2">n</span> of the Library, I have traveled i<span class="variation2">n</span> my youth; I have wa<span class="variation2">n</span>dered i<span class="variation2">n</span> search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; <span class="variation2">n</span>ow that my eyes ca<span class="variation2">n</span> hardly decipher what I write, I am prepari<span class="variation2">n</span>g to die just a few leagues from the hexago<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span> which I was bor<span class="variation2">n</span>. O<span class="variation2">n</span>ce I am dead, there will be <span class="variation2">n</span>o lack of pious ha<span class="variation2">n</span>ds to throw me over the raili<span class="variation2">n</span>g; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will si<span class="variation2">n</span>k e<span class="variation2">n</span>dlessly a<span class="variation2">n</span>d decay a<span class="variation2">n</span>d dissolve i<span class="variation2">n</span> the wi<span class="variation2">n</span>d ge<span class="variation2">n</span>erated by the fall, which is i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite. I say that the Library is u<span class="variation2">n</span>e<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g. The idealists argue that the hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>al rooms are a <span class="variation2">n</span>ecessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our i<span class="variation2">n</span>tuitio<span class="variation2">n</span> of space. They reaso<span class="variation2">n</span> that a tria<span class="variation2">n</span>gular or pe<span class="variation2">n</span>tago<span class="variation2">n</span>al room is i<span class="variation2">n</span>co<span class="variation2">n</span>ceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber co<span class="variation2">n</span>tai<span class="variation2">n</span>i<span class="variation2">n</span>g a great circular book, whose spi<span class="variation2">n</span>e is co<span class="variation2">n</span>ti<span class="variation2">n</span>uous a<span class="variation2">n</span>d which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimo<span class="variation2">n</span>y is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice <span class="variation2">n</span>ow for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact ce<span class="variation2">n</span>ter is a<span class="variation2">n</span>y o<span class="variation2">n</span>e of its hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s a<span class="variation2">n</span>d whose circumfere<span class="variation2">n</span>ce is i<span class="variation2">n</span>accessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>'s walls; each shelf co<span class="variation2">n</span>tai<span class="variation2">n</span>s thirty-five books of u<span class="variation2">n</span>iform format; each book is of four hu<span class="variation2">n</span>dred a<span class="variation2">n</span>d te<span class="variation2">n</span> pages; each page, of forty li<span class="variation2">n</span>es, each li<span class="variation2">n</span>e, of some eighty letters which are black i<span class="variation2">n</span> color. There are also letters o<span class="variation2">n</span> the spi<span class="variation2">n</span>e of each book; these letters do <span class="variation2">n</span>ot i<span class="variation2">n</span>dicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow that this i<span class="variation2">n</span>cohere<span class="variation2">n</span>ce at o<span class="variation2">n</span>e time seemed mysterious. Before summarizi<span class="variation2">n</span>g the solutio<span class="variation2">n</span> (whose discovery, i<span class="variation2">n</span> spite of its tragic projectio<span class="variation2">n</span>s, is perhaps the capital fact i<span class="variation2">n</span> history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeter<span class="variation2">n</span>o. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eter<span class="variation2">n</span>ity of the world, ca<span class="variation2">n</span><span class="variation2">n</span>ot be placed i<span class="variation2">n</span> doubt by a<span class="variation2">n</span>y reaso<span class="variation2">n</span>able mi<span class="variation2">n</span>d. Ma<span class="variation2">n</span>, the imperfect libraria<span class="variation2">n</span>, may be the product of cha<span class="variation2">n</span>ce or of malevole<span class="variation2">n</span>t demiurgi; the u<span class="variation2">n</span>iverse, with its elega<span class="variation2">n</span>t e<span class="variation2">n</span>dowme<span class="variation2">n</span>t of shelves, of e<span class="variation2">n</span>igmatical volumes, of i<span class="variation2">n</span>exhaustible stairways for the traveler a<span class="variation2">n</span>d latri<span class="variation2">n</span>es for the seated libraria<span class="variation2">n</span>, ca<span class="variation2">n</span> o<span class="variation2">n</span>ly be the work of a god. To perceive the dista<span class="variation2">n</span>ce betwee<span class="variation2">n</span> the divi<span class="variation2">n</span>e a<span class="variation2">n</span>d the huma<span class="variation2">n</span>, it is e<span class="variation2">n</span>ough to compare these crude waveri<span class="variation2">n</span>g symbols which my fallible ha<span class="variation2">n</span>d scrawls o<span class="variation2">n</span> the cover of a book, with the orga<span class="variation2">n</span>ic letters i<span class="variation2">n</span>side: pu<span class="variation2">n</span>ctual, delicate, perfectly black, i<span class="variation2">n</span>imitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Seco<span class="variation2">n</span>d: The orthographical symbols are twe<span class="variation2">n</span>ty-five i<span class="variation2">n</span> <span class="variation2">n</span>umber. ^ This fi<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g made it possible, three hu<span class="variation2">n</span>dred years ago, to formulate a ge<span class="variation2">n</span>eral theory of the Library a<span class="variation2">n</span>d solve satisfactorily the problem which <span class="variation2">n</span>o co<span class="variation2">n</span>jecture had deciphered: the formless a<span class="variation2">n</span>d chaotic <span class="variation2">n</span>ature of almost all the books. O<span class="variation2">n</span>e which my father saw i<span class="variation2">n</span> a hexago<span class="variation2">n</span> o<span class="variation2">n</span> circuit fiftee<span class="variation2">n</span> <span class="variation2">n</span>i<span class="variation2">n</span>ety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first li<span class="variation2">n</span>e to the last. A<span class="variation2">n</span>other (very much co<span class="variation2">n</span>sulted i<span class="variation2">n</span> this area) is a mere labyri<span class="variation2">n</span>th of letters, but the <span class="variation2">n</span>ext-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow<span class="variation2">n</span>: for every se<span class="variation2">n</span>sible li<span class="variation2">n</span>e of straightforward stateme<span class="variation2">n</span>t, there are leagues of se<span class="variation2">n</span>seless cacopho<span class="variation2">n</span>ies, verbal jumbles a<span class="variation2">n</span>d i<span class="variation2">n</span>cohere<span class="variation2">n</span>ces. (I k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow of a<span class="variation2">n</span> u<span class="variation2">n</span>couth regio<span class="variation2">n</span> whose libraria<span class="variation2">n</span>s repudiate the vai<span class="variation2">n</span> a<span class="variation2">n</span>d superstitious custom of fi<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g a mea<span class="variation2">n</span>i<span class="variation2">n</span>g i<span class="variation2">n</span> books a<span class="variation2">n</span>d equate it with that of fi<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g a mea<span class="variation2">n</span>i<span class="variation2">n</span>g i<span class="variation2">n</span> dreams or i<span class="variation2">n</span> the chaotic li<span class="variation2">n</span>es of o<span class="variation2">n</span>e's palm... They admit that the i<span class="variation2">n</span>ve<span class="variation2">n</span>tors of this writi<span class="variation2">n</span>g imitated the twe<span class="variation2">n</span>ty-five <span class="variation2">n</span>atural symbols, but mai<span class="variation2">n</span>tai<span class="variation2">n</span> that this applicatio<span class="variation2">n</span> is accide<span class="variation2">n</span>tal a<span class="variation2">n</span>d that the books sig<span class="variation2">n</span>ify <span class="variation2">n</span>othi<span class="variation2">n</span>g i<span class="variation2">n</span> themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is <span class="variation2">n</span>ot e<span class="variation2">n</span>tirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a lo<span class="variation2">n</span>g time it was believed that these impe<span class="variation2">n</span>etrable books correspo<span class="variation2">n</span>ded to past or remote la<span class="variation2">n</span>guages. It is true that the most a<span class="variation2">n</span>cie<span class="variation2">n</span>t me<span class="variation2">n</span>, the first libraria<span class="variation2">n</span>s, used a la<span class="variation2">n</span>guage quite differe<span class="variation2">n</span>t from the o<span class="variation2">n</span>e we <span class="variation2">n</span>ow speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the to<span class="variation2">n</span>gue is dialectical a<span class="variation2">n</span>d that <span class="variation2">n</span>i<span class="variation2">n</span>ety floors farther up, it is i<span class="variation2">n</span>comprehe<span class="variation2">n</span>sible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hu<span class="variation2">n</span>dred a<span class="variation2">n</span>d te<span class="variation2">n</span> pages of i<span class="variation2">n</span>alterable MCV's ca<span class="variation2">n</span><span class="variation2">n</span>ot correspo<span class="variation2">n</span>d to a<span class="variation2">n</span>y la<span class="variation2">n</span>guage, <span class="variation2">n</span>o matter how dialectical or rudime<span class="variation2">n</span>tary it may be. Some i<span class="variation2">n</span>si<span class="variation2">n</span>uated that each letter could i<span class="variation2">n</span>flue<span class="variation2">n</span>ce the followi<span class="variation2">n</span>g o<span class="variation2">n</span>e a<span class="variation2">n</span>d that the value of MCV i<span class="variation2">n</span> the third li<span class="variation2">n</span>e of page 7 (1) was <span class="variation2">n</span>ot the o<span class="variation2">n</span>e the same series may have i<span class="variation2">n</span> a<span class="variation2">n</span>other positio<span class="variation2">n</span> o<span class="variation2">n</span> a<span class="variation2">n</span>other page, but this vague thesis did <span class="variation2">n</span>ot prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; ge<span class="variation2">n</span>erally, this co<span class="variation2">n</span>jecture has bee<span class="variation2">n</span> accepted, though <span class="variation2">n</span>ot i<span class="variation2">n</span> the se<span class="variation2">n</span>se i<span class="variation2">n</span> which it was formulated by its origi<span class="variation2">n</span>ators.
      <br><br>
      Five hu<span class="variation2">n</span>dred years ago, the chief of a<span class="variation2">n</span> upper hexago<span class="variation2">n</span> (2) came upo<span class="variation2">n</span> a book as co<span class="variation2">n</span>fusi<span class="variation2">n</span>g as the others, but which had <span class="variation2">n</span>early two pages of homoge<span class="variation2">n</span>eous li<span class="variation2">n</span>es. He showed his fi<span class="variation2">n</span>d to a wa<span class="variation2">n</span>deri<span class="variation2">n</span>g decoder who told him the li<span class="variation2">n</span>es were writte<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span> Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Withi<span class="variation2">n</span> a ce<span class="variation2">n</span>tury, the la<span class="variation2">n</span>guage was established: a Samoyedic Lithua<span class="variation2">n</span>ia<span class="variation2">n</span> dialect of Guara<span class="variation2">n</span>i, with classical Arabia<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span>flectio<span class="variation2">n</span>s. The co<span class="variation2">n</span>te<span class="variation2">n</span>t was also deciphered: some <span class="variation2">n</span>otio<span class="variation2">n</span>s of combi<span class="variation2">n</span>ative a<span class="variation2">n</span>alysis, illustrated with examples of variatio<span class="variation2">n</span>s with u<span class="variation2">n</span>limited repetitio<span class="variation2">n</span>. These examples made it possible for a libraria<span class="variation2">n</span> of ge<span class="variation2">n</span>ius to discover the fu<span class="variation2">n</span>dame<span class="variation2">n</span>tal law of the Library. This thi<span class="variation2">n</span>ker observed that all the books, <span class="variation2">n</span>o matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same eleme<span class="variation2">n</span>ts: the space, the period, the comma, the twe<span class="variation2">n</span>ty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have co<span class="variation2">n</span>firmed: I<span class="variation2">n</span> the vast Library there are <span class="variation2">n</span>o two ide<span class="variation2">n</span>tical books. From these two i<span class="variation2">n</span>co<span class="variation2">n</span>trovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total a<span class="variation2">n</span>d that its shelves register all the possible combi<span class="variation2">n</span>atio<span class="variation2">n</span>s of the twe<span class="variation2">n</span>ty-odd orthographical symbols (a <span class="variation2">n</span>umber which, though extremely vast, is <span class="variation2">n</span>ot i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite): Everythi<span class="variation2">n</span>g: the mi<span class="variation2">n</span>utely detailed history of the future, the archa<span class="variation2">n</span>gels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousa<span class="variation2">n</span>ds a<span class="variation2">n</span>d thousa<span class="variation2">n</span>ds of false catalogues, the demo<span class="variation2">n</span>stratio<span class="variation2">n</span> of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demo<span class="variation2">n</span>stratio<span class="variation2">n</span> of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the G<span class="variation2">n</span>ostic gospel of Basilides, the comme<span class="variation2">n</span>tary o<span class="variation2">n</span> that gospel, the comme<span class="variation2">n</span>tary o<span class="variation2">n</span> the comme<span class="variation2">n</span>tary o<span class="variation2">n</span> that gospel, the true story of your death, the tra<span class="variation2">n</span>slatio<span class="variation2">n</span> of every book i<span class="variation2">n</span> all la<span class="variation2">n</span>guages, the i<span class="variation2">n</span>terpolatio<span class="variation2">n</span>s of every book i<span class="variation2">n</span> all books.
      <br><br>
      Whe<span class="variation2">n</span> it was proclaimed that the Library co<span class="variation2">n</span>tai<span class="variation2">n</span>ed all books, the first impressio<span class="variation2">n</span> was o<span class="variation2">n</span>e of extravaga<span class="variation2">n</span>t happi<span class="variation2">n</span>ess. All me<span class="variation2">n</span> felt themselves to be the masters of a<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span>tact a<span class="variation2">n</span>d secret treasure. There was <span class="variation2">n</span>o perso<span class="variation2">n</span>al or world problem whose eloque<span class="variation2">n</span>t solutio<span class="variation2">n</span> did <span class="variation2">n</span>ot exist i<span class="variation2">n</span> some hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>. The u<span class="variation2">n</span>iverse was justified, the u<span class="variation2">n</span>iverse sudde<span class="variation2">n</span>ly usurped the u<span class="variation2">n</span>limited dime<span class="variation2">n</span>sio<span class="variation2">n</span>s of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vi<span class="variation2">n</span>dicatio<span class="variation2">n</span>s: books of apology a<span class="variation2">n</span>d prophecy which vi<span class="variation2">n</span>dicated for all time the acts of every ma<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span> the u<span class="variation2">n</span>iverse a<span class="variation2">n</span>d retai<span class="variation2">n</span>ed prodigious arca<span class="variation2">n</span>a for his future. Thousa<span class="variation2">n</span>ds of the greedy aba<span class="variation2">n</span>do<span class="variation2">n</span>ed their sweet <span class="variation2">n</span>ative hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s a<span class="variation2">n</span>d rushed up the stairways, urged o<span class="variation2">n</span> by the vai<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span>te<span class="variation2">n</span>tio<span class="variation2">n</span> of fi<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g their Vi<span class="variation2">n</span>dicatio<span class="variation2">n</span>. These pilgrims disputed i<span class="variation2">n</span> the <span class="variation2">n</span>arrow corridors, proferred dark curses, stra<span class="variation2">n</span>gled each other o<span class="variation2">n</span> the divi<span class="variation2">n</span>e stairways, flu<span class="variation2">n</span>g the deceptive books i<span class="variation2">n</span>to the air shafts, met their death cast dow<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span> a similar fashio<span class="variation2">n</span> by the i<span class="variation2">n</span>habita<span class="variation2">n</span>ts of remote regio<span class="variation2">n</span>s. Others we<span class="variation2">n</span>t mad... The Vi<span class="variation2">n</span>dicatio<span class="variation2">n</span>s exist (I have see<span class="variation2">n</span> two which refer to perso<span class="variation2">n</span>s of the future, to perso<span class="variation2">n</span>s who are perhaps <span class="variation2">n</span>ot imagi<span class="variation2">n</span>ary) but the searchers did <span class="variation2">n</span>ot remember that the possibility of a ma<span class="variation2">n</span>'s fi<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g his Vi<span class="variation2">n</span>dicatio<span class="variation2">n</span>, or some treacherous variatio<span class="variation2">n</span> thereof, ca<span class="variation2">n</span> be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a clarificatio<span class="variation2">n</span> of huma<span class="variation2">n</span>ity's basic mysteries - the origi<span class="variation2">n</span> of the Library a<span class="variation2">n</span>d of time - might be fou<span class="variation2">n</span>d. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explai<span class="variation2">n</span>ed i<span class="variation2">n</span> words: if the la<span class="variation2">n</span>guage of philosophers is <span class="variation2">n</span>ot sufficie<span class="variation2">n</span>t, the multiform Library will have produced the u<span class="variation2">n</span>precede<span class="variation2">n</span>ted la<span class="variation2">n</span>guage required, with its vocabularies a<span class="variation2">n</span>d grammars. For four ce<span class="variation2">n</span>turies <span class="variation2">n</span>ow me<span class="variation2">n</span> have exhausted the hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s... There are official searchers, i<span class="variation2">n</span>quisitors. I have see<span class="variation2">n</span> them i<span class="variation2">n</span> the performa<span class="variation2">n</span>ce of their fu<span class="variation2">n</span>ctio<span class="variation2">n</span>: they always arrive extremely tired from their jour<span class="variation2">n</span>eys; they speak of a broke<span class="variation2">n</span> stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the libraria<span class="variation2">n</span> of galleries a<span class="variation2">n</span>d stairs; sometimes they pick up the <span class="variation2">n</span>earest volume a<span class="variation2">n</span>d leaf through it, looki<span class="variation2">n</span>g for i<span class="variation2">n</span>famous words. Obviously, <span class="variation2">n</span>o o<span class="variation2">n</span>e expects to discover a<span class="variation2">n</span>ythi<span class="variation2">n</span>g.
      <br><br>
      As was <span class="variation2">n</span>atural, this i<span class="variation2">n</span>ordi<span class="variation2">n</span>ate hope was followed by a<span class="variation2">n</span> excessive depressio<span class="variation2">n</span>. The certitude that some shelf i<span class="variation2">n</span> some hexago<span class="variation2">n</span> held precious books a<span class="variation2">n</span>d that these precious books were i<span class="variation2">n</span>accessible, seemed almost i<span class="variation2">n</span>tolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease a<span class="variation2">n</span>d that all me<span class="variation2">n</span> should juggle letters a<span class="variation2">n</span>d symbols u<span class="variation2">n</span>til they co<span class="variation2">n</span>structed, by a<span class="variation2">n</span> improbable gift of cha<span class="variation2">n</span>ce, these ca<span class="variation2">n</span>o<span class="variation2">n</span>ical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but i<span class="variation2">n</span> my childhood I have see<span class="variation2">n</span> old me<span class="variation2">n</span> who, for lo<span class="variation2">n</span>g periods of time, would hide i<span class="variation2">n</span> the latri<span class="variation2">n</span>es with some metal disks i<span class="variation2">n</span> a forbidde<span class="variation2">n</span> dice cup a<span class="variation2">n</span>d feebly mimic the divi<span class="variation2">n</span>e disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, i<span class="variation2">n</span>versely, believed that it was fu<span class="variation2">n</span>dame<span class="variation2">n</span>tal to elimi<span class="variation2">n</span>ate useless works. They i<span class="variation2">n</span>vaded the hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s, showed crede<span class="variation2">n</span>tials which were <span class="variation2">n</span>ot always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure a<span class="variation2">n</span>d co<span class="variation2">n</span>dem<span class="variation2">n</span>ed whole shelves: their hygie<span class="variation2">n</span>ic, ascetic furor caused the se<span class="variation2">n</span>seless perditio<span class="variation2">n</span> of millio<span class="variation2">n</span>s of books. Their <span class="variation2">n</span>ame is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this fre<span class="variation2">n</span>zy <span class="variation2">n</span>eglect two <span class="variation2">n</span>otable facts. O<span class="variation2">n</span>e: the Library is so e<span class="variation2">n</span>ormous that a<span class="variation2">n</span>y reductio<span class="variation2">n</span> of huma<span class="variation2">n</span> origi<span class="variation2">n</span> is i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>itesimal. The other: every copy is u<span class="variation2">n</span>ique, irreplaceable, but (si<span class="variation2">n</span>ce the Library is total) there are always several hu<span class="variation2">n</span>dred thousa<span class="variation2">n</span>d imperfect facsimiles: works which differ o<span class="variation2">n</span>ly i<span class="variation2">n</span> a letter or a comma. Cou<span class="variation2">n</span>ter to ge<span class="variation2">n</span>eral opi<span class="variation2">n</span>io<span class="variation2">n</span>, I ve<span class="variation2">n</span>ture to suppose that the co<span class="variation2">n</span>seque<span class="variation2">n</span>ces of the Purifiers' depredatio<span class="variation2">n</span>s have bee<span class="variation2">n</span> exaggerated by the horror these fa<span class="variation2">n</span>atics produced. They were urged o<span class="variation2">n</span> by the delirium of tryi<span class="variation2">n</span>g to reach the books i<span class="variation2">n</span> the Crimso<span class="variation2">n</span> Hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>: books whose format is smaller tha<span class="variation2">n</span> usual, all-powerful, illustrated a<span class="variation2">n</span>d magical.
      <br><br>
      We also k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow of a<span class="variation2">n</span>other superstitio<span class="variation2">n</span> of that time: that of the Ma<span class="variation2">n</span> of the Book. O<span class="variation2">n</span> some shelf i<span class="variation2">n</span> some hexago<span class="variation2">n</span> (me<span class="variation2">n</span> reaso<span class="variation2">n</span>ed) there must exist a book which is the formula a<span class="variation2">n</span>d perfect compe<span class="variation2">n</span>dium of all the rest: some libraria<span class="variation2">n</span> has go<span class="variation2">n</span>e through it a<span class="variation2">n</span>d he is a<span class="variation2">n</span>alogous to a god. I<span class="variation2">n</span> the la<span class="variation2">n</span>guage of this zo<span class="variation2">n</span>e vestiges of this remote fu<span class="variation2">n</span>ctio<span class="variation2">n</span>ary's cult still persist. Ma<span class="variation2">n</span>y wa<span class="variation2">n</span>dered i<span class="variation2">n</span> search of Him. For a ce<span class="variation2">n</span>tury they have exhausted i<span class="variation2">n</span> vai<span class="variation2">n</span> the most varied areas. How could o<span class="variation2">n</span>e locate the ve<span class="variation2">n</span>erated a<span class="variation2">n</span>d secret hexago<span class="variation2">n</span> which housed Him? Someo<span class="variation2">n</span>e proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, co<span class="variation2">n</span>sult first book B which i<span class="variation2">n</span>dicates A's positio<span class="variation2">n</span>; to locate book B, co<span class="variation2">n</span>sult first a book C, a<span class="variation2">n</span>d so o<span class="variation2">n</span> to i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ity... I<span class="variation2">n</span> adve<span class="variation2">n</span>tures such as these, I have squa<span class="variation2">n</span>dered a<span class="variation2">n</span>d wasted my years. It does <span class="variation2">n</span>ot seem u<span class="variation2">n</span>likely to me that there is a total book o<span class="variation2">n</span> some shelf of the u<span class="variation2">n</span>iverse (3) ; I pray to the u<span class="variation2">n</span>k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow<span class="variation2">n</span> gods that a ma<span class="variation2">n</span> - just o<span class="variation2">n</span>e, eve<span class="variation2">n</span> though it were thousa<span class="variation2">n</span>ds of years ago! - may have exami<span class="variation2">n</span>ed a<span class="variation2">n</span>d read it. If ho<span class="variation2">n</span>or a<span class="variation2">n</span>d wisdom a<span class="variation2">n</span>d happi<span class="variation2">n</span>ess are <span class="variation2">n</span>ot for me, let them be for others. Let heave<span class="variation2">n</span> exist, though my place be i<span class="variation2">n</span> hell. Let me be outraged a<span class="variation2">n</span>d a<span class="variation2">n</span><span class="variation2">n</span>ihilated, but for o<span class="variation2">n</span>e i<span class="variation2">n</span>sta<span class="variation2">n</span>t, i<span class="variation2">n</span> o<span class="variation2">n</span>e bei<span class="variation2">n</span>g, let Your e<span class="variation2">n</span>ormous Library be justified. The impious mai<span class="variation2">n</span>tai<span class="variation2">n</span> that <span class="variation2">n</span>o<span class="variation2">n</span>se<span class="variation2">n</span>se is <span class="variation2">n</span>ormal i<span class="variation2">n</span> the Library a<span class="variation2">n</span>d that the reaso<span class="variation2">n</span>able (a<span class="variation2">n</span>d eve<span class="variation2">n</span> humble a<span class="variation2">n</span>d pure cohere<span class="variation2">n</span>ce) is a<span class="variation2">n</span> almost miraculous exceptio<span class="variation2">n</span>. They speak (I k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow) of the "feverish Library whose cha<span class="variation2">n</span>ce volumes are co<span class="variation2">n</span>sta<span class="variation2">n</span>tly i<span class="variation2">n</span> da<span class="variation2">n</span>ger of cha<span class="variation2">n</span>gi<span class="variation2">n</span>g i<span class="variation2">n</span>to others a<span class="variation2">n</span>d affirm, <span class="variation2">n</span>egate a<span class="variation2">n</span>d co<span class="variation2">n</span>fuse everythi<span class="variation2">n</span>g like a delirious divi<span class="variation2">n</span>ity." These words, which <span class="variation2">n</span>ot o<span class="variation2">n</span>ly de<span class="variation2">n</span>ou<span class="variation2">n</span>ce the disorder but exemplify it as well, <span class="variation2">n</span>otoriously prove their authors' abomi<span class="variation2">n</span>able taste a<span class="variation2">n</span>d desperate ig<span class="variation2">n</span>ora<span class="variation2">n</span>ce. I<span class="variation2">n</span> truth, the Library i<span class="variation2">n</span>cludes all verbal structures, all variatio<span class="variation2">n</span>s permitted by the twe<span class="variation2">n</span>ty-five orthographical symbols, but <span class="variation2">n</span>ot a si<span class="variation2">n</span>gle example of absolute <span class="variation2">n</span>o<span class="variation2">n</span>se<span class="variation2">n</span>se. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the ma<span class="variation2">n</span>y hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s u<span class="variation2">n</span>der my admi<span class="variation2">n</span>istratio<span class="variation2">n</span> is e<span class="variation2">n</span>titled The Combed Thu<span class="variation2">n</span>derclap a<span class="variation2">n</span>d a<span class="variation2">n</span>other The Plaster Cramp a<span class="variation2">n</span>d a<span class="variation2">n</span>other Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first gla<span class="variation2">n</span>ce i<span class="variation2">n</span>cohere<span class="variation2">n</span>t, ca<span class="variation2">n</span> <span class="variation2">n</span>o doubt be justified i<span class="variation2">n</span> a cryptographical or allegorical ma<span class="variation2">n</span><span class="variation2">n</span>er; such a justificatio<span class="variation2">n</span> is verbal a<span class="variation2">n</span>d, ex hypothesi, already figures i<span class="variation2">n</span> the Library.

      which the divi<span class="variation2">n</span>e Library has <span class="variation2">n</span>ot foresee<span class="variation2">n</span> a<span class="variation2">n</span>d which i<span class="variation2">n</span> o<span class="variation2">n</span>e of its secret to<span class="variation2">n</span>gues do <span class="variation2">n</span>ot co<span class="variation2">n</span>tai<span class="variation2">n</span> a terrible mea<span class="variation2">n</span>i<span class="variation2">n</span>g. <span class="variation2">N</span>o o<span class="variation2">n</span>e ca<span class="variation2">n</span> articulate a syllable which is <span class="variation2">n</span>ot filled with te<span class="variation2">n</span>der<span class="variation2">n</span>ess a<span class="variation2">n</span>d fear, which is <span class="variation2">n</span>ot, i<span class="variation2">n</span> o<span class="variation2">n</span>e of these la<span class="variation2">n</span>guages, the powerful <span class="variation2">n</span>ame of a god. To speak is to fall i<span class="variation2">n</span>to tautology. This wordy a<span class="variation2">n</span>d useless epistle already exists i<span class="variation2">n</span> o<span class="variation2">n</span>e of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of o<span class="variation2">n</span>e of the i<span class="variation2">n</span><span class="variation2">n</span>umerable hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s - a<span class="variation2">n</span>d its refutatio<span class="variation2">n</span> as well. (A<span class="variation2">n</span> <span class="variation2">n</span> <span class="variation2">n</span>umber of possible la<span class="variation2">n</span>guages use the same vocabulary; i<span class="variation2">n</span> some of them, the symbol library allows the correct defi<span class="variation2">n</span>itio<span class="variation2">n</span> a ubiquitous a<span class="variation2">n</span>d lasti<span class="variation2">n</span>g system of hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>al galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or a<span class="variation2">n</span>ythi<span class="variation2">n</span>g else, a<span class="variation2">n</span>d these seve<span class="variation2">n</span> words which defi<span class="variation2">n</span>e it have a<span class="variation2">n</span>other value. You who read me, are You sure of u<span class="variation2">n</span>dersta<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g my la<span class="variation2">n</span>guage?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of writi<span class="variation2">n</span>g distracts me from the prese<span class="variation2">n</span>t state of me<span class="variation2">n</span>. The certitude that everythi<span class="variation2">n</span>g has bee<span class="variation2">n</span> writte<span class="variation2">n</span> <span class="variation2">n</span>egates us or tur<span class="variation2">n</span>s us i<span class="variation2">n</span>to pha<span class="variation2">n</span>toms. I k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow of districts i<span class="variation2">n</span> which the you<span class="variation2">n</span>g me<span class="variation2">n</span> prostrate themselves before books a<span class="variation2">n</span>d kiss their pages i<span class="variation2">n</span> a barbarous ma<span class="variation2">n</span><span class="variation2">n</span>er, but they do <span class="variation2">n</span>ot k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow how to decipher a si<span class="variation2">n</span>gle letter. Epidemics, heretical co<span class="variation2">n</span>flicts, peregri<span class="variation2">n</span>atio<span class="variation2">n</span>s which i<span class="variation2">n</span>evitably dege<span class="variation2">n</span>erate i<span class="variation2">n</span>to ba<span class="variation2">n</span>ditry, have decimated the populatio<span class="variation2">n</span>. I believe I have me<span class="variation2">n</span>tio<span class="variation2">n</span>ed suicides, more a<span class="variation2">n</span>d more freque<span class="variation2">n</span>t with the years. Perhaps my old age a<span class="variation2">n</span>d fearful<span class="variation2">n</span>ess deceive me, but I suspect that the huma<span class="variation2">n</span> species - the u<span class="variation2">n</span>ique species - is about to be exti<span class="variation2">n</span>guished, but the Library will e<span class="variation2">n</span>dure: illumi<span class="variation2">n</span>ated, solitary, i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite, perfectly motio<span class="variation2">n</span>less, equipped with precious volumes, useless, i<span class="variation2">n</span>corruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just writte<span class="variation2">n</span> the word "i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite".' I have <span class="variation2">n</span>ot i<span class="variation2">n</span>terpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is <span class="variation2">n</span>ot illogical to thi<span class="variation2">n</span>k that the world is i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite. Those who judge it to be limited postulate that i<span class="variation2">n</span> remote places the corridors a<span class="variation2">n</span>d stairways a<span class="variation2">n</span>d hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s ca<span class="variation2">n</span> co<span class="variation2">n</span>ceivably come to a<span class="variation2">n</span> e<span class="variation2">n</span>d - which is absurd. Those who imagi<span class="variation2">n</span>e it to be without limit forget that the possible <span class="variation2">n</span>umber of books does have such a limit. I ve<span class="variation2">n</span>ture to suggest this solutio<span class="variation2">n</span> to the a<span class="variation2">n</span>cie<span class="variation2">n</span>t problem: The Library is u<span class="variation2">n</span>limited a<span class="variation2">n</span>d cyclical. If a<span class="variation2">n</span> eter<span class="variation2">n</span>al traveler were to cross it i<span class="variation2">n</span> a<span class="variation2">n</span>y directio<span class="variation2">n</span>, after ce<span class="variation2">n</span>turies he would see that the same volumes were repeated i<span class="variation2">n</span> the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be a<span class="variation2">n</span> order: the Order). My solitude is gladde<span class="variation2">n</span>ed by this elega<span class="variation2">n</span>t hope (4).

      Tra<span class="variation2">n</span>slated by J. E. I.
      <br><br>
      1. The origi<span class="variation2">n</span>al ma<span class="variation2">n</span>uscript does <span class="variation2">n</span>ot co<span class="variation2">n</span>tai<span class="variation2">n</span> digits or capital letters. The pu<span class="variation2">n</span>ctuatio<span class="variation2">n</span> has bee<span class="variation2">n</span> limited to the comma a<span class="variation2">n</span>d the period. These two sig<span class="variation2">n</span>s, the space a<span class="variation2">n</span>d the twe<span class="variation2">n</span>ty-two letters of the alphabet are the twe<span class="variation2">n</span>ty-five symbols co<span class="variation2">n</span>sidered sufficie<span class="variation2">n</span>t by this u<span class="variation2">n</span>k<span class="variation2">n</span>ow<span class="variation2">n</span> author. (Editor's <span class="variation2">n</span>ote.)
      <br><br>
      2. Before, there was a ma<span class="variation2">n</span> for every three hexago<span class="variation2">n</span>s. Suicide a<span class="variation2">n</span>d pulmo<span class="variation2">n</span>ary diseases have destroyed that proportio<span class="variation2">n</span>. A memory of u<span class="variation2">n</span>speakable mela<span class="variation2">n</span>choly: at times I have traveled for ma<span class="variation2">n</span>y <span class="variation2">n</span>ights through corridors a<span class="variation2">n</span>d alo<span class="variation2">n</span>g polished stairways without fi<span class="variation2">n</span>di<span class="variation2">n</span>g a si<span class="variation2">n</span>gle libraria<span class="variation2">n</span>.
      <br><br>
      3. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. O<span class="variation2">n</span>ly the impossible is excluded. For example: <span class="variation2">n</span>o book ca<span class="variation2">n</span> be a ladder, although <span class="variation2">n</span>o doubt there are books which discuss a<span class="variation2">n</span>d <span class="variation2">n</span>egate a<span class="variation2">n</span>d demo<span class="variation2">n</span>strate this possibility a<span class="variation2">n</span>d others whose structure correspo<span class="variation2">n</span>ds to that of a ladder.

      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaki<span class="variation2">n</span>g, a si<span class="variation2">n</span>gle volume would be sufficie<span class="variation2">n</span>t, a volume of ordi<span class="variation2">n</span>ary format, pri<span class="variation2">n</span>ted i<span class="variation2">n</span> <span class="variation2">n</span>i<span class="variation2">n</span>e or te<span class="variation2">n</span> poi<span class="variation2">n</span>t type, co<span class="variation2">n</span>tai<span class="variation2">n</span>i<span class="variation2">n</span>g a<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite <span class="variation2">n</span>umber if i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>itely thi<span class="variation2">n</span> leaves. (I<span class="variation2">n</span> the early seve<span class="variation2">n</span>tee<span class="variation2">n</span>th ce<span class="variation2">n</span>tury, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimpositio<span class="variation2">n</span> of a<span class="variation2">n</span> i<span class="variation2">n</span>fi<span class="variation2">n</span>ite <span class="variation2">n</span>umber of pla<span class="variation2">n</span>es.) The ha<span class="variation2">n</span>dli<span class="variation2">n</span>g of this silky vade mecum would <span class="variation2">n</span>ot be co<span class="variation2">n</span>ve<span class="variation2">n</span>ie<span class="variation2">n</span>t: each appare<span class="variation2">n</span>t page would u<span class="variation2">n</span>fold i<span class="variation2">n</span>to other a<span class="variation2">n</span>alogous o<span class="variation2">n</span>es; the i<span class="variation2">n</span>co<span class="variation2">n</span>ceivable middle page would have <span class="variation2">n</span>o reverse.
