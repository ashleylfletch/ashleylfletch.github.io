      The Anatomy of Melan<span class="variation3">c</span>holy, part 2, se<span class="variation3">c</span>t. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h others <span class="variation3">c</span>all the Library) is <span class="variation3">c</span>omposed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one <span class="variation3">c</span>an see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, <span class="variation3">c</span>over all the sides ex<span class="variation3">c</span>ept two; their height, whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h is the distan<span class="variation3">c</span>e from floor to <span class="variation3">c</span>eiling, s<span class="variation3">c</span>ar<span class="variation3">c</span>ely ex<span class="variation3">c</span>eeds that of a normal book<span class="variation3">c</span>ase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h opens onto another gallery, identi<span class="variation3">c</span>al to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small <span class="variation3">c</span>losets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fe<span class="variation3">c</span>al ne<span class="variation3">c</span>essities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distan<span class="variation3">c</span>es. In the hallway there is a mirror whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h faithfully dupli<span class="variation3">c</span>ates all appearan<span class="variation3">c</span>es. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory dupli<span class="variation3">c</span>ation?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfa<span class="variation3">c</span>es represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spheri<span class="variation3">c</span>al fruit whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally pla<span class="variation3">c</span>ed, in ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h hexagon. The light they emit is insuffi<span class="variation3">c</span>ient, in<span class="variation3">c</span>essant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in sear<span class="variation3">c</span>h of a book, perhaps the <span class="variation3">c</span>atalogue of <span class="variation3">c</span>atalogues; now that my eyes <span class="variation3">c</span>an hardly de<span class="variation3">c</span>ipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h I was born. On<span class="variation3">c</span>e I am dead, there will be no la<span class="variation3">c</span>k of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and de<span class="variation3">c</span>ay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a ne<span class="variation3">c</span>essary form of absolute spa<span class="variation3">c</span>e or, at least, of our intuition of spa<span class="variation3">c</span>e. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is in<span class="variation3">c</span>on<span class="variation3">c</span>eivable. (The mysti<span class="variation3">c</span>s <span class="variation3">c</span>laim that their e<span class="variation3">c</span>stasy reveals to them a <span class="variation3">c</span>ir<span class="variation3">c</span>ular <span class="variation3">c</span>hamber <span class="variation3">c</span>ontaining a great <span class="variation3">c</span>ir<span class="variation3">c</span>ular book, whose spine is <span class="variation3">c</span>ontinuous and whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h follows the <span class="variation3">c</span>omplete <span class="variation3">c</span>ir<span class="variation3">c</span>le of the walls; but their testimony is suspe<span class="variation3">c</span>t; their words, obs<span class="variation3">c</span>ure. This <span class="variation3">c</span>y<span class="variation3">c</span>li<span class="variation3">c</span>al book is God.) Let it suffi<span class="variation3">c</span>e now for me to repeat the <span class="variation3">c</span>lassi<span class="variation3">c</span> di<span class="variation3">c</span>tum: The Library is a sphere whose exa<span class="variation3">c</span>t <span class="variation3">c</span>enter is any one of its hexagons and whose <span class="variation3">c</span>ir<span class="variation3">c</span>umferen<span class="variation3">c</span>e is ina<span class="variation3">c</span><span class="variation3">c</span>essible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h of the hexagon's walls; ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h shelf <span class="variation3">c</span>ontains thirty-five books of uniform format; ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h book is of four hundred and ten pages; ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h page, of forty lines, ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h line, of some eighty letters whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h are bla<span class="variation3">c</span>k in <span class="variation3">c</span>olor. There are also letters on the spine of ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h book; these letters do not indi<span class="variation3">c</span>ate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this in<span class="variation3">c</span>oheren<span class="variation3">c</span>e at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose dis<span class="variation3">c</span>overy, in spite of its tragi<span class="variation3">c</span> proje<span class="variation3">c</span>tions, is perhaps the <span class="variation3">c</span>apital fa<span class="variation3">c</span>t in history) I wish to re<span class="variation3">c</span>all a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate <span class="variation3">c</span>orollary is the future eternity of the world, <span class="variation3">c</span>annot be pla<span class="variation3">c</span>ed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfe<span class="variation3">c</span>t librarian, may be the produ<span class="variation3">c</span>t of <span class="variation3">c</span>han<span class="variation3">c</span>e or of malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmati<span class="variation3">c</span>al volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, <span class="variation3">c</span>an only be the work of a god. To per<span class="variation3">c</span>eive the distan<span class="variation3">c</span>e between the divine and the human, it is enough to <span class="variation3">c</span>ompare these <span class="variation3">c</span>rude wavering symbols whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h my fallible hand s<span class="variation3">c</span>rawls on the <span class="variation3">c</span>over of a book, with the organi<span class="variation3">c</span> letters inside: pun<span class="variation3">c</span>tual, deli<span class="variation3">c</span>ate, perfe<span class="variation3">c</span>tly bla<span class="variation3">c</span>k, inimitably symmetri<span class="variation3">c</span>al.
      <br><br>
      Se<span class="variation3">c</span>ond: The orthographi<span class="variation3">c</span>al symbols are twenty-five in number.^ This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfa<span class="variation3">c</span>torily the problem whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h no <span class="variation3">c</span>onje<span class="variation3">c</span>ture had de<span class="variation3">c</span>iphered: the formless and <span class="variation3">c</span>haoti<span class="variation3">c</span> nature of almost all the books. One whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h my father saw in a hexagon on <span class="variation3">c</span>ir<span class="variation3">c</span>uit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters M<span class="variation3">C</span>V, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very mu<span class="variation3">c</span>h <span class="variation3">c</span>onsulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This mu<span class="variation3">c</span>h is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless <span class="variation3">c</span>a<span class="variation3">c</span>ophonies, verbal jumbles and in<span class="variation3">c</span>oheren<span class="variation3">c</span>es. (I know of an un<span class="variation3">c</span>outh region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious <span class="variation3">c</span>ustom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the <span class="variation3">c</span>haoti<span class="variation3">c</span> lines of one's palm... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this appli<span class="variation3">c</span>ation is a<span class="variation3">c</span><span class="variation3">c</span>idental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This di<span class="variation3">c</span>tum, we shall see, is not entirely falla<span class="variation3">c</span>ious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books <span class="variation3">c</span>orresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most an<span class="variation3">c</span>ient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is diale<span class="variation3">c</span>ti<span class="variation3">c</span>al and that ninety floors farther up, it is in<span class="variation3">c</span>omprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable M<span class="variation3">C</span>V's <span class="variation3">c</span>annot <span class="variation3">c</span>orrespond to any language, no matter how diale<span class="variation3">c</span>ti<span class="variation3">c</span>al or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h letter <span class="variation3">c</span>ould influen<span class="variation3">c</span>e the following one and that the value of M<span class="variation3">C</span>V in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of <span class="variation3">c</span>ryptographs; generally, this <span class="variation3">c</span>onje<span class="variation3">c</span>ture has been a<span class="variation3">c</span><span class="variation3">c</span>epted, though not in the sense in whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h it was formulated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred years ago, the <span class="variation3">c</span>hief of an upper hexagon 2 <span class="variation3">c</span>ame upon a book as <span class="variation3">c</span>onfusing as the others, but whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering de<span class="variation3">c</span>oder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a <span class="variation3">c</span>entury, the language was established: a Samoyedi<span class="variation3">c</span> Lithuanian diale<span class="variation3">c</span>t of Guarani, with <span class="variation3">c</span>lassi<span class="variation3">c</span>al Arabian infle<span class="variation3">c</span>tions. The <span class="variation3">c</span>ontent was also de<span class="variation3">c</span>iphered: some notions of <span class="variation3">c</span>ombinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to dis<span class="variation3">c</span>over the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the spa<span class="variation3">c</span>e, the period, the <span class="variation3">c</span>omma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fa<span class="variation3">c</span>t whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h travelers have <span class="variation3">c</span>onfirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identi<span class="variation3">c</span>al books. From these two in<span class="variation3">c</span>ontrovertible premises he dedu<span class="variation3">c</span>ed that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible <span class="variation3">c</span>ombinations of the twenty-odd orthographi<span class="variation3">c</span>al symbols (a number whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the ar<span class="variation3">c</span>hangels' autobiographies, the faithful <span class="variation3">c</span>atalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false <span class="variation3">c</span>atalogues, the demonstration of the falla<span class="variation3">c</span>y of those <span class="variation3">c</span>atalogues, the demonstration of the falla<span class="variation3">c</span>y of the true <span class="variation3">c</span>atalogue, the Gnosti<span class="variation3">c</span> gospel of Basilides, the <span class="variation3">c</span>ommentary on that gospel, the <span class="variation3">c</span>ommentary on the <span class="variation3">c</span>ommentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was pro<span class="variation3">c</span>laimed that the Library <span class="variation3">c</span>ontained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an inta<span class="variation3">c</span>t and se<span class="variation3">c</span>ret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindi<span class="variation3">c</span>ations: books of apology and prophe<span class="variation3">c</span>y whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h vindi<span class="variation3">c</span>ated for all time the a<span class="variation3">c</span>ts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious ar<span class="variation3">c</span>ana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindi<span class="variation3">c</span>ation. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow <span class="variation3">c</span>orridors, proferred dark <span class="variation3">c</span>urses, strangled ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h other on the divine stairways, flung the de<span class="variation3">c</span>eptive books into the air shafts, met their death <span class="variation3">c</span>ast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindi<span class="variation3">c</span>ations exist (I have seen two whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the sear<span class="variation3">c</span>hers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindi<span class="variation3">c</span>ation, or some trea<span class="variation3">c</span>herous variation thereof, <span class="variation3">c</span>an be <span class="variation3">c</span>omputed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a <span class="variation3">c</span>larifi<span class="variation3">c</span>ation of humanity's basi<span class="variation3">c</span> mysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries <span class="variation3">c</span>ould be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not suffi<span class="variation3">c</span>ient, the multiform Library will have produ<span class="variation3">c</span>ed the unpre<span class="variation3">c</span>edented language required, with its vo<span class="variation3">c</span>abularies and grammars. For four <span class="variation3">c</span>enturies now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are offi<span class="variation3">c</span>ial sear<span class="variation3">c</span>hers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performan<span class="variation3">c</span>e of their fun<span class="variation3">c</span>tion: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pi<span class="variation3">c</span>k up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. Obviously, no one expe<span class="variation3">c</span>ts to dis<span class="variation3">c</span>over anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an ex<span class="variation3">c</span>essive depression. The <span class="variation3">c</span>ertitude that some shelf in some hexagon held pre<span class="variation3">c</span>ious books and that these pre<span class="variation3">c</span>ious books were ina<span class="variation3">c</span><span class="variation3">c</span>essible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous se<span class="variation3">c</span>t suggested that the sear<span class="variation3">c</span>hes should <span class="variation3">c</span>ease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they <span class="variation3">c</span>onstru<span class="variation3">c</span>ted, by an improbable gift of <span class="variation3">c</span>han<span class="variation3">c</span>e, these <span class="variation3">c</span>anoni<span class="variation3">c</span>al books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The se<span class="variation3">c</span>t disappeared, but in my <span class="variation3">c</span>hildhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden di<span class="variation3">c</span>e <span class="variation3">c</span>up and feebly mimi<span class="variation3">c</span> the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed <span class="variation3">c</span>redentials whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and <span class="variation3">c</span>ondemned whole shelves: their hygieni<span class="variation3">c</span>, as<span class="variation3">c</span>eti<span class="variation3">c</span> furor <span class="variation3">c</span>aused the senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is exe<span class="variation3">c</span>rated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy negle<span class="variation3">c</span>t two notable fa<span class="variation3">c</span>ts. One: the Library is so enormous that any redu<span class="variation3">c</span>tion of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every <span class="variation3">c</span>opy is unique, irrepla<span class="variation3">c</span>eable, but (sin<span class="variation3">c</span>e the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand imperfe<span class="variation3">c</span>t fa<span class="variation3">c</span>similes: works whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h differ only in a letter or a <span class="variation3">c</span>omma. <span class="variation3">C</span>ounter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the <span class="variation3">c</span>onsequen<span class="variation3">c</span>es of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanati<span class="variation3">c</span>s produ<span class="variation3">c</span>ed. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to rea<span class="variation3">c</span>h the books in the <span class="variation3">C</span>rimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magi<span class="variation3">c</span>al.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h is the formula and perfe<span class="variation3">c</span>t <span class="variation3">c</span>ompendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote fun<span class="variation3">c</span>tionary's <span class="variation3">c</span>ult still persist. Many wandered in sear<span class="variation3">c</span>h of Him. For a <span class="variation3">c</span>entury they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How <span class="variation3">c</span>ould one lo<span class="variation3">c</span>ate the venerated and se<span class="variation3">c</span>ret hexagon whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To lo<span class="variation3">c</span>ate book A, <span class="variation3">c</span>onsult first book B whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h indi<span class="variation3">c</span>ates A's position; to lo<span class="variation3">c</span>ate book B, <span class="variation3">c</span>onsult first a book <span class="variation3">C</span>, and so on to infinity... In adventures su<span class="variation3">c</span>h as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe 3 ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my pla<span class="variation3">c</span>e be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure <span class="variation3">c</span>oheren<span class="variation3">c</span>e) is an almost mira<span class="variation3">c</span>ulous ex<span class="variation3">c</span>eption. They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose <span class="variation3">c</span>han<span class="variation3">c</span>e volumes are <span class="variation3">c</span>onstantly in danger of <span class="variation3">c</span>hanging into others and affirm, negate and <span class="variation3">c</span>onfuse everything like a delirious divinity." These words, whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h not only denoun<span class="variation3">c</span>e the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignoran<span class="variation3">c</span>e. In truth, the Library in<span class="variation3">c</span>ludes all verbal stru<span class="variation3">c</span>tures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographi<span class="variation3">c</span>al symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The <span class="variation3">C</span>ombed Thunder<span class="variation3">c</span>lap and another The Plaster <span class="variation3">C</span>ramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glan<span class="variation3">c</span>e in<span class="variation3">c</span>oherent, <span class="variation3">c</span>an no doubt be justified in a <span class="variation3">c</span>ryptographi<span class="variation3">c</span>al or allegori<span class="variation3">c</span>al manner; su<span class="variation3">c</span>h a justifi<span class="variation3">c</span>ation is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I <span class="variation3">c</span>annot <span class="variation3">c</span>ombine some <span class="variation3">c</span>hara<span class="variation3">c</span>ters
      <br><br>
      dh<span class="variation3">c</span>mrl<span class="variation3">c</span>htdj
      <br><br>
      whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h the divine Library has not foreseen and whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h in one of its se<span class="variation3">c</span>ret tongues do not <span class="variation3">c</span>ontain a terrible meaning. No one <span class="variation3">c</span>an arti<span class="variation3">c</span>ulate a syllable whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h is not filled with tenderness and fear, whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of possible languages use the same vo<span class="variation3">c</span>abulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the <span class="variation3">c</span>orre<span class="variation3">c</span>t definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)
      <br><br>
      The methodi<span class="variation3">c</span>al task of writing distra<span class="variation3">c</span>ts me from the present state of men. The <span class="variation3">c</span>ertitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of distri<span class="variation3">c</span>ts in whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to de<span class="variation3">c</span>ipher a single letter. Epidemi<span class="variation3">c</span>s, hereti<span class="variation3">c</span>al <span class="variation3">c</span>onfli<span class="variation3">c</span>ts, peregrinations whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h inevitably degenerate into banditry, have de<span class="variation3">c</span>imated the population. I believe I have mentioned sui<span class="variation3">c</span>ides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old age and fearfulness de<span class="variation3">c</span>eive me, but I suspe<span class="variation3">c</span>t that the human spe<span class="variation3">c</span>ies - the unique spe<span class="variation3">c</span>ies - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfe<span class="variation3">c</span>tly motionless, equipped with pre<span class="variation3">c</span>ious volumes, useless, in<span class="variation3">c</span>orruptible, se<span class="variation3">c</span>ret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the word "infinite".' I have not interpolated this adje<span class="variation3">c</span>tive out of rhetori<span class="variation3">c</span>al habit; I say that it is not illogi<span class="variation3">c</span>al to think that the world is infinite. Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote pla<span class="variation3">c</span>es the <span class="variation3">c</span>orridors and stairways and hexagons <span class="variation3">c</span>an <span class="variation3">c</span>on<span class="variation3">c</span>eivably <span class="variation3">c</span>ome to an end - whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have su<span class="variation3">c</span>h a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the an<span class="variation3">c</span>ient problem: The Library is unlimited and <span class="variation3">c</span>y<span class="variation3">c</span>li<span class="variation3">c</span>al. If an eternal traveler were to <span class="variation3">c</span>ross it in any dire<span class="variation3">c</span>tion, after <span class="variation3">c</span>enturies he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope 4.

      <br><br>
      The original manus<span class="variation3">c</span>ript does not <span class="variation3">c</span>ontain digits or <span class="variation3">c</span>apital letters. The pun<span class="variation3">c</span>tuation has been limited to the <span class="variation3">c</span>omma and the period. These two signs, the spa<span class="variation3">c</span>e and the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the twenty-five symbols <span class="variation3">c</span>onsidered suffi<span class="variation3">c</span>ient by this unknown author. (Editor's note.)

      2. Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Sui<span class="variation3">c</span>ide and pulmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melan<span class="variation3">c</span>holy: at times I have traveled for many nights through <span class="variation3">c</span>orridors and along polished stairways without finding a single librarian.
      <br>
      3. I repeat: it suffi<span class="variation3">c</span>es that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is ex<span class="variation3">c</span>luded. For example: no book <span class="variation3">c</span>an be a ladder, although no doubt there are books whi<span class="variation3">c</span>h dis<span class="variation3">c</span>uss and negate and demonstrate this possibility and others whose stru<span class="variation3">c</span>ture <span class="variation3">c</span>orresponds to that of a ladder.

      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a single volume would be suffi<span class="variation3">c</span>ient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, <span class="variation3">c</span>ontaining an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth <span class="variation3">c</span>entury, <span class="variation3">C</span>avalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of this silky vade me<span class="variation3">c</span>um would not be <span class="variation3">c</span>onvenient: ea<span class="variation3">c</span>h apparent page would unfold into other analogous ones; the in<span class="variation3">c</span>on<span class="variation3">c</span>eivable middle page would have no reverse.
