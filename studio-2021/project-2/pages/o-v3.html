      By this art y<span class="variation3">o</span>u may c<span class="variation3">o</span>ntemplate the variati<span class="variation3">o</span>ns <span class="variation3">o</span>f the 23 letters...
      The Anat<span class="variation3">o</span>my <span class="variation3">o</span>f Melanch<span class="variation3">o</span>ly, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which <span class="variation3">o</span>thers call the Library) is c<span class="variation3">o</span>mp<span class="variation3">o</span>sed <span class="variation3">o</span>f an indefinite and perhaps infinite number <span class="variation3">o</span>f hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>nal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surr<span class="variation3">o</span>unded by very l<span class="variation3">o</span>w railings. Fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m any <span class="variation3">o</span>f the hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>ns <span class="variation3">o</span>ne can see, interminably, the upper and l<span class="variation3">o</span>wer fl<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>rs. The distributi<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five l<span class="variation3">o</span>ng shelves per side, c<span class="variation3">o</span>ver all the sides except tw<span class="variation3">o</span>; their height, which is the distance fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m fl<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>r t<span class="variation3">o</span> ceiling, scarcely exceeds that <span class="variation3">o</span>f a n<span class="variation3">o</span>rmal b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>kcase. <span class="variation3">O</span>ne <span class="variation3">o</span>f the free sides leads t<span class="variation3">o</span> a narr<span class="variation3">o</span>w hallway which <span class="variation3">o</span>pens <span class="variation3">o</span>nt<span class="variation3">o</span> an<span class="variation3">o</span>ther gallery, identical t<span class="variation3">o</span> the first and t<span class="variation3">o</span> all the rest. T<span class="variation3">o</span> the left and right <span class="variation3">o</span>f the hallway there are tw<span class="variation3">o</span> very small cl<span class="variation3">o</span>sets. In the first, <span class="variation3">o</span>ne may sleep standing up; in the <span class="variation3">o</span>ther, satisfy <span class="variation3">o</span>ne's fecal necessities. Als<span class="variation3">o</span> thr<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and s<span class="variation3">o</span>ars upwards t<span class="variation3">o</span> rem<span class="variation3">o</span>te distances. In the hallway there is a mirr<span class="variation3">o</span>r which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m this mirr<span class="variation3">o</span>r that the Library is n<span class="variation3">o</span>t infinite (if it were, why this illus<span class="variation3">o</span>ry duplicati<span class="variation3">o</span>n?); I prefer t<span class="variation3">o</span> dream that its p<span class="variation3">o</span>lished surfaces represent and pr<span class="variation3">o</span>mise the infinite... Light is pr<span class="variation3">o</span>vided by s<span class="variation3">o</span>me spherical fruit which bear the name <span class="variation3">o</span>f lamps. There are tw<span class="variation3">o</span>, transversally placed, in each hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>n. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men <span class="variation3">o</span>f the Library, I have traveled in my y<span class="variation3">o</span>uth; I have wandered in search <span class="variation3">o</span>f a b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k, perhaps the catal<span class="variation3">o</span>gue <span class="variation3">o</span>f catal<span class="variation3">o</span>gues; n<span class="variation3">o</span>w that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing t<span class="variation3">o</span> die just a few leagues fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m the hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>n in which I was b<span class="variation3">o</span>rn. <span class="variation3">O</span>nce I am dead, there will be n<span class="variation3">o</span> lack <span class="variation3">o</span>f pi<span class="variation3">o</span>us hands t<span class="variation3">o</span> thr<span class="variation3">o</span>w me <span class="variation3">o</span>ver the railing; my grave will be the fath<span class="variation3">o</span>mless air; my b<span class="variation3">o</span>dy will sink endlessly and decay and diss<span class="variation3">o</span>lve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>nal r<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ms are a necessary f<span class="variation3">o</span>rm <span class="variation3">o</span>f abs<span class="variation3">o</span>lute space <span class="variation3">o</span>r, at least, <span class="variation3">o</span>f <span class="variation3">o</span>ur intuiti<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f space. They reas<span class="variation3">o</span>n that a triangular <span class="variation3">o</span>r pentag<span class="variation3">o</span>nal r<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>m is inc<span class="variation3">o</span>nceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals t<span class="variation3">o</span> them a circular chamber c<span class="variation3">o</span>ntaining a great circular b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k, wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se spine is c<span class="variation3">o</span>ntinu<span class="variation3">o</span>us and which f<span class="variation3">o</span>ll<span class="variation3">o</span>ws the c<span class="variation3">o</span>mplete circle <span class="variation3">o</span>f the walls; but their testim<span class="variation3">o</span>ny is suspect; their w<span class="variation3">o</span>rds, <span class="variation3">o</span>bscure. This cyclical b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k is G<span class="variation3">o</span>d.) Let it suffice n<span class="variation3">o</span>w f<span class="variation3">o</span>r me t<span class="variation3">o</span> repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se exact center is any <span class="variation3">o</span>ne <span class="variation3">o</span>f its hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>ns and wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se circumference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves f<span class="variation3">o</span>r each <span class="variation3">o</span>f the hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>n's walls; each shelf c<span class="variation3">o</span>ntains thirty-five b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks <span class="variation3">o</span>f unif<span class="variation3">o</span>rm f<span class="variation3">o</span>rmat; each b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k is <span class="variation3">o</span>f f<span class="variation3">o</span>ur hundred and ten pages; each page, <span class="variation3">o</span>f f<span class="variation3">o</span>rty lines, each line, <span class="variation3">o</span>f s<span class="variation3">o</span>me eighty letters which are black in c<span class="variation3">o</span>l<span class="variation3">o</span>r. There are als<span class="variation3">o</span> letters <span class="variation3">o</span>n the spine <span class="variation3">o</span>f each b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k; these letters d<span class="variation3">o</span> n<span class="variation3">o</span>t indicate <span class="variation3">o</span>r prefigure what the pages will say. I kn<span class="variation3">o</span>w that this inc<span class="variation3">o</span>herence at <span class="variation3">o</span>ne time seemed mysteri<span class="variation3">o</span>us. Bef<span class="variation3">o</span>re summarizing the s<span class="variation3">o</span>luti<span class="variation3">o</span>n (wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se disc<span class="variation3">o</span>very, in spite <span class="variation3">o</span>f its tragic pr<span class="variation3">o</span>jecti<span class="variation3">o</span>ns, is perhaps the capital fact in hist<span class="variation3">o</span>ry) I wish t<span class="variation3">o</span> recall a few axi<span class="variation3">o</span>ms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aetern<span class="variation3">o</span>. This truth, wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se immediate c<span class="variation3">o</span>r<span class="variation3">o</span>llary is the future eternity <span class="variation3">o</span>f the w<span class="variation3">o</span>rld, cann<span class="variation3">o</span>t be placed in d<span class="variation3">o</span>ubt by any reas<span class="variation3">o</span>nable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the pr<span class="variation3">o</span>duct <span class="variation3">o</span>f chance <span class="variation3">o</span>r <span class="variation3">o</span>f malev<span class="variation3">o</span>lent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant end<span class="variation3">o</span>wment <span class="variation3">o</span>f shelves, <span class="variation3">o</span>f enigmatical v<span class="variation3">o</span>lumes, <span class="variation3">o</span>f inexhaustible stairways f<span class="variation3">o</span>r the traveler and latrines f<span class="variation3">o</span>r the seated librarian, can <span class="variation3">o</span>nly be the w<span class="variation3">o</span>rk <span class="variation3">o</span>f a g<span class="variation3">o</span>d. T<span class="variation3">o</span> perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is en<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh t<span class="variation3">o</span> c<span class="variation3">o</span>mpare these crude wavering symb<span class="variation3">o</span>ls which my fallible hand scrawls <span class="variation3">o</span>n the c<span class="variation3">o</span>ver <span class="variation3">o</span>f a b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k, with the <span class="variation3">o</span>rganic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Sec<span class="variation3">o</span>nd: The <span class="variation3">o</span>rth<span class="variation3">o</span>graphical symb<span class="variation3">o</span>ls are twenty-five in number. ^ This finding made it p<span class="variation3">o</span>ssible, three hundred years ag<span class="variation3">o</span>, t<span class="variation3">o</span> f<span class="variation3">o</span>rmulate a general the<span class="variation3">o</span>ry <span class="variation3">o</span>f the Library and s<span class="variation3">o</span>lve satisfact<span class="variation3">o</span>rily the pr<span class="variation3">o</span>blem which n<span class="variation3">o</span> c<span class="variation3">o</span>njecture had deciphered: the f<span class="variation3">o</span>rmless and cha<span class="variation3">o</span>tic nature <span class="variation3">o</span>f alm<span class="variation3">o</span>st all the b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks. <span class="variation3">O</span>ne which my father saw in a hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>n circuit fifteen ninety-f<span class="variation3">o</span>ur was made up <span class="variation3">o</span>f the letters MCV, perversely repeated fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m the first line t<span class="variation3">o</span> the last. An<span class="variation3">o</span>ther (very much c<span class="variation3">o</span>nsulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth <span class="variation3">o</span>f letters, but the next-t<span class="variation3">o</span>-last page says <span class="variation3">O</span>h time thy pyramids. This much is already kn<span class="variation3">o</span>wn: f<span class="variation3">o</span>r every sensible line <span class="variation3">o</span>f straightf<span class="variation3">o</span>rward statement, there are leagues <span class="variation3">o</span>f senseless cac<span class="variation3">o</span>ph<span class="variation3">o</span>nies, verbal jumbles and inc<span class="variation3">o</span>herences. (I kn<span class="variation3">o</span>w <span class="variation3">o</span>f an unc<span class="variation3">o</span>uth regi<span class="variation3">o</span>n wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se librarians repudiate the vain and superstiti<span class="variation3">o</span>us cust<span class="variation3">o</span>m <span class="variation3">o</span>f finding a meaning in b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks and equate it with that <span class="variation3">o</span>f finding a meaning in dreams <span class="variation3">o</span>r in the cha<span class="variation3">o</span>tic lines <span class="variation3">o</span>f <span class="variation3">o</span>ne's palm... They admit that the invent<span class="variation3">o</span>rs <span class="variation3">o</span>f this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symb<span class="variation3">o</span>ls, but maintain that this applicati<span class="variation3">o</span>n is accidental and that the b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks signify n<span class="variation3">o</span>thing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is n<span class="variation3">o</span>t entirely fallaci<span class="variation3">o</span>us.)
      <br><br>
      F<span class="variation3">o</span>r a l<span class="variation3">o</span>ng time it was believed that these impenetrable b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks c<span class="variation3">o</span>rresp<span class="variation3">o</span>nded t<span class="variation3">o</span> past <span class="variation3">o</span>r rem<span class="variation3">o</span>te languages. It is true that the m<span class="variation3">o</span>st ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m the <span class="variation3">o</span>ne we n<span class="variation3">o</span>w speak; it is true that a few miles t<span class="variation3">o</span> the right the t<span class="variation3">o</span>ngue is dialectical and that ninety fl<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>rs farther up, it is inc<span class="variation3">o</span>mprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but f<span class="variation3">o</span>ur hundred and ten pages <span class="variation3">o</span>f inalterable MCV's cann<span class="variation3">o</span>t c<span class="variation3">o</span>rresp<span class="variation3">o</span>nd t<span class="variation3">o</span> any language, n<span class="variation3">o</span> matter h<span class="variation3">o</span>w dialectical <span class="variation3">o</span>r rudimentary it may be. S<span class="variation3">o</span>me insinuated that each letter c<span class="variation3">o</span>uld influence the f<span class="variation3">o</span>ll<span class="variation3">o</span>wing <span class="variation3">o</span>ne and that the value <span class="variation3">o</span>f MCV in the third line <span class="variation3">o</span>f page 7 (1) was n<span class="variation3">o</span>t the <span class="variation3">o</span>ne the same series may have in an<span class="variation3">o</span>ther p<span class="variation3">o</span>siti<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>n an<span class="variation3">o</span>ther page, but this vague thesis did n<span class="variation3">o</span>t prevail. <span class="variation3">O</span>thers th<span class="variation3">o</span>ught <span class="variation3">o</span>f crypt<span class="variation3">o</span>graphs; generally, this c<span class="variation3">o</span>njecture has been accepted, th<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh n<span class="variation3">o</span>t in the sense in which it was f<span class="variation3">o</span>rmulated by its <span class="variation3">o</span>riginat<span class="variation3">o</span>rs.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred years ag<span class="variation3">o</span>, the chief <span class="variation3">o</span>f an upper hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>n (2) came up<span class="variation3">o</span>n a b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k as c<span class="variation3">o</span>nfusing as the <span class="variation3">o</span>thers, but which had nearly tw<span class="variation3">o</span> pages <span class="variation3">o</span>f h<span class="variation3">o</span>m<span class="variation3">o</span>gene<span class="variation3">o</span>us lines. He sh<span class="variation3">o</span>wed his find t<span class="variation3">o</span> a wandering dec<span class="variation3">o</span>der wh<span class="variation3">o</span> t<span class="variation3">o</span>ld him the lines were written in P<span class="variation3">o</span>rtuguese; <span class="variation3">o</span>thers said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Sam<span class="variation3">o</span>yedic Lithuanian dialect <span class="variation3">o</span>f Guarani, with classical Arabian inflecti<span class="variation3">o</span>ns. The c<span class="variation3">o</span>ntent was als<span class="variation3">o</span> deciphered: s<span class="variation3">o</span>me n<span class="variation3">o</span>ti<span class="variation3">o</span>ns <span class="variation3">o</span>f c<span class="variation3">o</span>mbinative analysis, illustrated with examples <span class="variation3">o</span>f variati<span class="variation3">o</span>ns with unlimited repetiti<span class="variation3">o</span>n. These examples made it p<span class="variation3">o</span>ssible f<span class="variation3">o</span>r a librarian <span class="variation3">o</span>f genius t<span class="variation3">o</span> disc<span class="variation3">o</span>ver the fundamental law <span class="variation3">o</span>f the Library. This thinker <span class="variation3">o</span>bserved that all the b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks, n<span class="variation3">o</span> matter h<span class="variation3">o</span>w diverse they might be, are made up <span class="variation3">o</span>f the same elements: the space, the peri<span class="variation3">o</span>d, the c<span class="variation3">o</span>mma, the twenty-tw<span class="variation3">o</span> letters <span class="variation3">o</span>f the alphabet. He als<span class="variation3">o</span> alleged a fact which travelers have c<span class="variation3">o</span>nfirmed: In the vast Library there are n<span class="variation3">o</span> tw<span class="variation3">o</span> identical b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks. Fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m these tw<span class="variation3">o</span> inc<span class="variation3">o</span>ntr<span class="variation3">o</span>vertible premises he deduced that the Library is t<span class="variation3">o</span>tal and that its shelves register all the p<span class="variation3">o</span>ssible c<span class="variation3">o</span>mbinati<span class="variation3">o</span>ns <span class="variation3">o</span>f the twenty-<span class="variation3">o</span>dd <span class="variation3">o</span>rth<span class="variation3">o</span>graphical symb<span class="variation3">o</span>ls (a number which, th<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh extremely vast, is n<span class="variation3">o</span>t infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed hist<span class="variation3">o</span>ry <span class="variation3">o</span>f the future, the archangels' aut<span class="variation3">o</span>bi<span class="variation3">o</span>graphies, the faithful catal<span class="variation3">o</span>gues <span class="variation3">o</span>f the Library, th<span class="variation3">o</span>usands and th<span class="variation3">o</span>usands <span class="variation3">o</span>f false catal<span class="variation3">o</span>gues, the dem<span class="variation3">o</span>nstrati<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f the fallacy <span class="variation3">o</span>f th<span class="variation3">o</span>se catal<span class="variation3">o</span>gues, the dem<span class="variation3">o</span>nstrati<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f the fallacy <span class="variation3">o</span>f the true catal<span class="variation3">o</span>gue, the Gn<span class="variation3">o</span>stic g<span class="variation3">o</span>spel <span class="variation3">o</span>f Basilides, the c<span class="variation3">o</span>mmentary <span class="variation3">o</span>n that g<span class="variation3">o</span>spel, the c<span class="variation3">o</span>mmentary <span class="variation3">o</span>n the c<span class="variation3">o</span>mmentary <span class="variation3">o</span>n that g<span class="variation3">o</span>spel, the true st<span class="variation3">o</span>ry <span class="variation3">o</span>f y<span class="variation3">o</span>ur death, the translati<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f every b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k in all languages, the interp<span class="variation3">o</span>lati<span class="variation3">o</span>ns <span class="variation3">o</span>f every b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k in all b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks.
      <br><br>
      When it was pr<span class="variation3">o</span>claimed that the Library c<span class="variation3">o</span>ntained all b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks, the first impressi<span class="variation3">o</span>n was <span class="variation3">o</span>ne <span class="variation3">o</span>f extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves t<span class="variation3">o</span> be the masters <span class="variation3">o</span>f an intact and secret treasure. There was n<span class="variation3">o</span> pers<span class="variation3">o</span>nal <span class="variation3">o</span>r w<span class="variation3">o</span>rld pr<span class="variation3">o</span>blem wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se el<span class="variation3">o</span>quent s<span class="variation3">o</span>luti<span class="variation3">o</span>n did n<span class="variation3">o</span>t exist in s<span class="variation3">o</span>me hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>n. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensi<span class="variation3">o</span>ns <span class="variation3">o</span>f h<span class="variation3">o</span>pe. At that time a great deal was said ab<span class="variation3">o</span>ut the Vindicati<span class="variation3">o</span>ns: b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks <span class="variation3">o</span>f ap<span class="variation3">o</span>l<span class="variation3">o</span>gy and pr<span class="variation3">o</span>phecy which vindicated f<span class="variation3">o</span>r all time the acts <span class="variation3">o</span>f every man in the universe and retained pr<span class="variation3">o</span>digi<span class="variation3">o</span>us arcana f<span class="variation3">o</span>r his future. Th<span class="variation3">o</span>usands <span class="variation3">o</span>f the greedy aband<span class="variation3">o</span>ned their sweet native hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>ns and rushed up the stairways, urged <span class="variation3">o</span>n by the vain intenti<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f finding their Vindicati<span class="variation3">o</span>n. These pilgrims disputed in the narr<span class="variation3">o</span>w c<span class="variation3">o</span>rrid<span class="variation3">o</span>rs, pr<span class="variation3">o</span>ferred dark curses, strangled each <span class="variation3">o</span>ther <span class="variation3">o</span>n the divine stairways, flung the deceptive b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks int<span class="variation3">o</span> the air shafts, met their death cast d<span class="variation3">o</span>wn in a similar fashi<span class="variation3">o</span>n by the inhabitants <span class="variation3">o</span>f rem<span class="variation3">o</span>te regi<span class="variation3">o</span>ns. <span class="variation3">O</span>thers went mad... The Vindicati<span class="variation3">o</span>ns exist (I have seen tw<span class="variation3">o</span> which refer t<span class="variation3">o</span> pers<span class="variation3">o</span>ns <span class="variation3">o</span>f the future, t<span class="variation3">o</span> pers<span class="variation3">o</span>ns wh<span class="variation3">o</span> are perhaps n<span class="variation3">o</span>t imaginary) but the searchers did n<span class="variation3">o</span>t remember that the p<span class="variation3">o</span>ssibility <span class="variation3">o</span>f a man's finding his Vindicati<span class="variation3">o</span>n, <span class="variation3">o</span>r s<span class="variation3">o</span>me treacher<span class="variation3">o</span>us variati<span class="variation3">o</span>n there<span class="variation3">o</span>f, can be c<span class="variation3">o</span>mputed as zer<span class="variation3">o</span>.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was als<span class="variation3">o</span> h<span class="variation3">o</span>ped that a clarificati<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f humanity's basic mysteries - the <span class="variation3">o</span>rigin <span class="variation3">o</span>f the Library and <span class="variation3">o</span>f time - might be f<span class="variation3">o</span>und. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries c<span class="variation3">o</span>uld be explained in w<span class="variation3">o</span>rds: if the language <span class="variation3">o</span>f phil<span class="variation3">o</span>s<span class="variation3">o</span>phers is n<span class="variation3">o</span>t sufficient, the multif<span class="variation3">o</span>rm Library will have pr<span class="variation3">o</span>duced the unprecedented language required, with its v<span class="variation3">o</span>cabularies and grammars. F<span class="variation3">o</span>r f<span class="variation3">o</span>ur centuries n<span class="variation3">o</span>w men have exhausted the hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>ns... There are <span class="variation3">o</span>fficial searchers, inquisit<span class="variation3">o</span>rs. I have seen them in the perf<span class="variation3">o</span>rmance <span class="variation3">o</span>f their functi<span class="variation3">o</span>n: they always arrive extremely tired fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m their j<span class="variation3">o</span>urneys; they speak <span class="variation3">o</span>f a br<span class="variation3">o</span>ken stairway which alm<span class="variation3">o</span>st killed them; they talk with the librarian <span class="variation3">o</span>f galleries and stairs; s<span class="variation3">o</span>metimes they pick up the nearest v<span class="variation3">o</span>lume and leaf thr<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh it, l<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>king f<span class="variation3">o</span>r infam<span class="variation3">o</span>us w<span class="variation3">o</span>rds. <span class="variation3">O</span>bvi<span class="variation3">o</span>usly, n<span class="variation3">o</span> <span class="variation3">o</span>ne expects t<span class="variation3">o</span> disc<span class="variation3">o</span>ver anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this in<span class="variation3">o</span>rdinate h<span class="variation3">o</span>pe was f<span class="variation3">o</span>ll<span class="variation3">o</span>wed by an excessive depressi<span class="variation3">o</span>n. The certitude that s<span class="variation3">o</span>me shelf in s<span class="variation3">o</span>me hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>n held preci<span class="variation3">o</span>us b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks and that these preci<span class="variation3">o</span>us b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks were inaccessible, seemed alm<span class="variation3">o</span>st int<span class="variation3">o</span>lerable. A blasphem<span class="variation3">o</span>us sect suggested that the searches sh<span class="variation3">o</span>uld cease and that all men sh<span class="variation3">o</span>uld juggle letters and symb<span class="variation3">o</span>ls until they c<span class="variation3">o</span>nstructed, by an impr<span class="variation3">o</span>bable gift <span class="variation3">o</span>f chance, these can<span class="variation3">o</span>nical b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks. The auth<span class="variation3">o</span>rities were <span class="variation3">o</span>bliged t<span class="variation3">o</span> issue severe <span class="variation3">o</span>rders. The sect disappeared, but in my childh<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>d I have seen <span class="variation3">o</span>ld men wh<span class="variation3">o</span>, f<span class="variation3">o</span>r l<span class="variation3">o</span>ng peri<span class="variation3">o</span>ds <span class="variation3">o</span>f time, w<span class="variation3">o</span>uld hide in the latrines with s<span class="variation3">o</span>me metal disks in a f<span class="variation3">o</span>rbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine dis<span class="variation3">o</span>rder.
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation3">O</span>thers, inversely, believed that it was fundamental t<span class="variation3">o</span> eliminate useless w<span class="variation3">o</span>rks. They invaded the hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>ns, sh<span class="variation3">o</span>wed credentials which were n<span class="variation3">o</span>t always false, leafed thr<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh a v<span class="variation3">o</span>lume with displeasure and c<span class="variation3">o</span>ndemned wh<span class="variation3">o</span>le shelves: their hygienic, ascetic fur<span class="variation3">o</span>r caused the senseless perditi<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f milli<span class="variation3">o</span>ns <span class="variation3">o</span>f b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks. Their name is execrated, but th<span class="variation3">o</span>se wh<span class="variation3">o</span> depl<span class="variation3">o</span>re the "treasures" destr<span class="variation3">o</span>yed by this frenzy neglect tw<span class="variation3">o</span> n<span class="variation3">o</span>table facts. <span class="variation3">O</span>ne: the Library is s<span class="variation3">o</span> en<span class="variation3">o</span>rm<span class="variation3">o</span>us that any reducti<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f human <span class="variation3">o</span>rigin is infinitesimal. The <span class="variation3">o</span>ther: every c<span class="variation3">o</span>py is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is t<span class="variation3">o</span>tal) there are always several hundred th<span class="variation3">o</span>usand imperfect facsimiles: w<span class="variation3">o</span>rks which differ <span class="variation3">o</span>nly in a letter <span class="variation3">o</span>r a c<span class="variation3">o</span>mma. C<span class="variation3">o</span>unter t<span class="variation3">o</span> general <span class="variation3">o</span>pini<span class="variation3">o</span>n, I venture t<span class="variation3">o</span> supp<span class="variation3">o</span>se that the c<span class="variation3">o</span>nsequences <span class="variation3">o</span>f the Purifiers' depredati<span class="variation3">o</span>ns have been exaggerated by the h<span class="variation3">o</span>rr<span class="variation3">o</span>r these fanatics pr<span class="variation3">o</span>duced. They were urged <span class="variation3">o</span>n by the delirium <span class="variation3">o</span>f trying t<span class="variation3">o</span> reach the b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks in the Crims<span class="variation3">o</span>n Hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>n: b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se f<span class="variation3">o</span>rmat is smaller than usual, all-p<span class="variation3">o</span>werful, illustrated and magical.

Many wandered in search <span class="variation3">o</span>f Him. F<span class="variation3">o</span>r a century they have exhausted in vain the m<span class="variation3">o</span>st varied areas.

In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It d<span class="variation3">o</span>es n<span class="variation3">o</span>t seem unlikely t<span class="variation3">o</span> me that there is a t<span class="variation3">o</span>tal b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k <span class="variation3">o</span>n s<span class="variation3">o</span>me shelf <span class="variation3">o</span>f the universe (3) ; I pray t<span class="variation3">o</span> the unkn<span class="variation3">o</span>wn g<span class="variation3">o</span>ds that a man - just <span class="variation3">o</span>ne, even th<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh it were th<span class="variation3">o</span>usands <span class="variation3">o</span>f years ag<span class="variation3">o</span>! - may have examined and read it.

(An n number <span class="variation3">o</span>f p<span class="variation3">o</span>ssible languages use the same v<span class="variation3">o</span>cabulary; in s<span class="variation3">o</span>me <span class="variation3">o</span>f them, the symb<span class="variation3">o</span>l library all<span class="variation3">o</span>ws the c<span class="variation3">o</span>rrect definiti<span class="variation3">o</span>n a ubiquit<span class="variation3">o</span>us and lasting system <span class="variation3">o</span>f hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>nal galleries, but library is bread <span class="variation3">o</span>r pyramid <span class="variation3">o</span>r anything else, and these seven w<span class="variation3">o</span>rds which define it have an<span class="variation3">o</span>ther value.

      <br><br>
      The meth<span class="variation3">o</span>dical task <span class="variation3">o</span>f writing distracts me fr<span class="variation3">o</span>m the present state <span class="variation3">o</span>f men. The certitude that everything has been written negates us <span class="variation3">o</span>r turns us int<span class="variation3">o</span> phant<span class="variation3">o</span>ms. I kn<span class="variation3">o</span>w <span class="variation3">o</span>f districts in which the y<span class="variation3">o</span>ung men pr<span class="variation3">o</span>strate themselves bef<span class="variation3">o</span>re b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks and kiss their pages in a barbar<span class="variation3">o</span>us manner, but they d<span class="variation3">o</span> n<span class="variation3">o</span>t kn<span class="variation3">o</span>w h<span class="variation3">o</span>w t<span class="variation3">o</span> decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical c<span class="variation3">o</span>nflicts, peregrinati<span class="variation3">o</span>ns which inevitably degenerate int<span class="variation3">o</span> banditry, have decimated the p<span class="variation3">o</span>pulati<span class="variation3">o</span>n. I believe I have menti<span class="variation3">o</span>ned suicides, m<span class="variation3">o</span>re and m<span class="variation3">o</span>re frequent with the years. Perhaps my <span class="variation3">o</span>ld age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is ab<span class="variation3">o</span>ut t<span class="variation3">o</span> be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, s<span class="variation3">o</span>litary, infinite, perfectly m<span class="variation3">o</span>ti<span class="variation3">o</span>nless, equipped with preci<span class="variation3">o</span>us v<span class="variation3">o</span>lumes, useless, inc<span class="variation3">o</span>rruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the w<span class="variation3">o</span>rd "infinite".' I have n<span class="variation3">o</span>t interp<span class="variation3">o</span>lated this adjective <span class="variation3">o</span>ut <span class="variation3">o</span>f rhet<span class="variation3">o</span>rical habit; I say that it is n<span class="variation3">o</span>t ill<span class="variation3">o</span>gical t<span class="variation3">o</span> think that the w<span class="variation3">o</span>rld is infinite. Th<span class="variation3">o</span>se wh<span class="variation3">o</span> judge it t<span class="variation3">o</span> be limited p<span class="variation3">o</span>stulate that in rem<span class="variation3">o</span>te places the c<span class="variation3">o</span>rrid<span class="variation3">o</span>rs and stairways and hexag<span class="variation3">o</span>ns can c<span class="variation3">o</span>nceivably c<span class="variation3">o</span>me t<span class="variation3">o</span> an end - which is absurd.

A mem<span class="variation3">o</span>ry <span class="variation3">o</span>f unspeakable melanch<span class="variation3">o</span>ly: at times I have traveled f<span class="variation3">o</span>r many nights thr<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh c<span class="variation3">o</span>rrid<span class="variation3">o</span>rs and al<span class="variation3">o</span>ng p<span class="variation3">o</span>lished stairways with<span class="variation3">o</span>ut finding a single librarian.

      3. I repeat: it suffices that a b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k be p<span class="variation3">o</span>ssible f<span class="variation3">o</span>r it t<span class="variation3">o</span> exist. <span class="variation3">O</span>nly the imp<span class="variation3">o</span>ssible is excluded. F<span class="variation3">o</span>r example: n<span class="variation3">o</span> b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>k can be a ladder, alth<span class="variation3">o</span>ugh n<span class="variation3">o</span> d<span class="variation3">o</span>ubt there are b<span class="variation3">o</span><span class="variation3">o</span>ks which discuss and negate and dem<span class="variation3">o</span>nstrate this p<span class="variation3">o</span>ssibility and <span class="variation3">o</span>thers wh<span class="variation3">o</span>se structure c<span class="variation3">o</span>rresp<span class="variation3">o</span>nds t<span class="variation3">o</span> that <span class="variation3">o</span>f a ladder.

      4. Letizia Alvarez de T<span class="variation3">o</span>led<span class="variation3">o</span> has <span class="variation3">o</span>bserved that this vast Library is useless: rig<span class="variation3">o</span>r<span class="variation3">o</span>usly speaking, a single v<span class="variation3">o</span>lume w<span class="variation3">o</span>uld be sufficient, a v<span class="variation3">o</span>lume <span class="variation3">o</span>f <span class="variation3">o</span>rdinary f<span class="variation3">o</span>rmat, printed in nine <span class="variation3">o</span>r ten p<span class="variation3">o</span>int type, c<span class="variation3">o</span>ntaining an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all s<span class="variation3">o</span>lid b<span class="variation3">o</span>dies are the superimp<span class="variation3">o</span>siti<span class="variation3">o</span>n <span class="variation3">o</span>f an infinite number <span class="variation3">o</span>f planes.) The handling <span class="variation3">o</span>f this silky vade mecum w<span class="variation3">o</span>uld n<span class="variation3">o</span>t be c<span class="variation3">o</span>nvenient: each apparent page w<span class="variation3">o</span>uld unf<span class="variation3">o</span>ld int<span class="variation3">o</span> <span class="variation3">o</span>ther anal<span class="variation3">o</span>g<span class="variation3">o</span>us <span class="variation3">o</span>nes; the inc<span class="variation3">o</span>nceivable middle page w<span class="variation3">o</span>uld have n<span class="variation3">o</span> reverse.
