      The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The <span class="variation3">u</span>niverse (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite n<span class="variation3">u</span>mber of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, s<span class="variation3">u</span>rro<span class="variation3">u</span>nded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the <span class="variation3">u</span>pper and lower floors. The distrib<span class="variation3">u</span>tion of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing <span class="variation3">u</span>p; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also thro<span class="variation3">u</span>gh here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars <span class="variation3">u</span>pwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithf<span class="variation3">u</span>lly d<span class="variation3">u</span>plicates all appearances. Men <span class="variation3">u</span>s<span class="variation3">u</span>ally infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this ill<span class="variation3">u</span>sory d<span class="variation3">u</span>plication?); I prefer to dream that its polished s<span class="variation3">u</span>rfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spherical fr<span class="variation3">u</span>it which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is ins<span class="variation3">u</span>fficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my yo<span class="variation3">u</span>th; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalog<span class="variation3">u</span>e of catalog<span class="variation3">u</span>es; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die j<span class="variation3">u</span>st a few leag<span class="variation3">u</span>es from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pio<span class="variation3">u</span>s hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is <span class="variation3">u</span>nending. The idealists arg<span class="variation3">u</span>e that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absol<span class="variation3">u</span>te space or, at least, of o<span class="variation3">u</span>r int<span class="variation3">u</span>ition of space. They reason that a triang<span class="variation3">u</span>lar or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circ<span class="variation3">u</span>lar chamber containing a great circ<span class="variation3">u</span>lar book, whose spine is contin<span class="variation3">u</span>o<span class="variation3">u</span>s and which follows the complete circle of the walls; b<span class="variation3">u</span>t their testimony is s<span class="variation3">u</span>spect; their words, obsc<span class="variation3">u</span>re. This cyclical book is God.) Let it s<span class="variation3">u</span>ffice now for me to repeat the classic dict<span class="variation3">u</span>m: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circ<span class="variation3">u</span>mference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of <span class="variation3">u</span>niform format; each book is of fo<span class="variation3">u</span>r h<span class="variation3">u</span>ndred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefig<span class="variation3">u</span>re what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterio<span class="variation3">u</span>s. Before s<span class="variation3">u</span>mmarizing the sol<span class="variation3">u</span>tion (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This tr<span class="variation3">u</span>th, whose immediate corollary is the f<span class="variation3">u</span>t<span class="variation3">u</span>re eternity of the world, cannot be placed in do<span class="variation3">u</span>bt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the prod<span class="variation3">u</span>ct of chance or of malevolent demi<span class="variation3">u</span>rgi; the <span class="variation3">u</span>niverse, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical vol<span class="variation3">u</span>mes, of inexha<span class="variation3">u</span>stible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the h<span class="variation3">u</span>man, it is eno<span class="variation3">u</span>gh to compare these cr<span class="variation3">u</span>de wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: p<span class="variation3">u</span>nct<span class="variation3">u</span>al, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in n<span class="variation3">u</span>mber. ^ This finding made it possible, three h<span class="variation3">u</span>ndred years ago, to form<span class="variation3">u</span>late a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conject<span class="variation3">u</span>re had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nat<span class="variation3">u</span>re of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circ<span class="variation3">u</span>it fifteen ninety-fo<span class="variation3">u</span>r was made <span class="variation3">u</span>p of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very m<span class="variation3">u</span>ch cons<span class="variation3">u</span>lted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This m<span class="variation3">u</span>ch is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leag<span class="variation3">u</span>es of senseless cacophonies, verbal j<span class="variation3">u</span>mbles and incoherences. (I know of an <span class="variation3">u</span>nco<span class="variation3">u</span>th region whose librarians rep<span class="variation3">u</span>diate the vain and s<span class="variation3">u</span>perstitio<span class="variation3">u</span>s c<span class="variation3">u</span>stom of finding a meaning in books and eq<span class="variation3">u</span>ate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five nat<span class="variation3">u</span>ral symbols, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dict<span class="variation3">u</span>m, we shall see, is not entirely fallacio<span class="variation3">u</span>s.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote lang<span class="variation3">u</span>ages. It is tr<span class="variation3">u</span>e that the most ancient men, the first librarians, <span class="variation3">u</span>sed a lang<span class="variation3">u</span>age q<span class="variation3">u</span>ite different from the one we now speak; it is tr<span class="variation3">u</span>e that a few miles to the right the tong<span class="variation3">u</span>e is dialectical and that ninety floors farther <span class="variation3">u</span>p, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is tr<span class="variation3">u</span>e, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t fo<span class="variation3">u</span>r h<span class="variation3">u</span>ndred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any lang<span class="variation3">u</span>age, no matter how dialectical or r<span class="variation3">u</span>dimentary it may be. Some insin<span class="variation3">u</span>ated that each letter co<span class="variation3">u</span>ld infl<span class="variation3">u</span>ence the following one and that the val<span class="variation3">u</span>e of MCV in the third line of page 7 (1) was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t this vag<span class="variation3">u</span>e thesis did not prevail. Others tho<span class="variation3">u</span>ght of cryptographs; generally, this conject<span class="variation3">u</span>re has been accepted, tho<span class="variation3">u</span>gh not in the sense in which it was form<span class="variation3">u</span>lated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five h<span class="variation3">u</span>ndred years ago, the chief of an <span class="variation3">u</span>pper hexagon (2) came <span class="variation3">u</span>pon a book as conf<span class="variation3">u</span>sing as the others, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t which had nearly two pages of homogeneo<span class="variation3">u</span>s lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Port<span class="variation3">u</span>g<span class="variation3">u</span>ese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a cent<span class="variation3">u</span>ry, the lang<span class="variation3">u</span>age was established: a Samoyedic Lith<span class="variation3">u</span>anian dialect of G<span class="variation3">u</span>arani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, ill<span class="variation3">u</span>strated with examples of variations with <span class="variation3">u</span>nlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of geni<span class="variation3">u</span>s to discover the f<span class="variation3">u</span>ndamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made <span class="variation3">u</span>p of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he ded<span class="variation3">u</span>ced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a n<span class="variation3">u</span>mber which, tho<span class="variation3">u</span>gh extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the min<span class="variation3">u</span>tely detailed history of the f<span class="variation3">u</span>t<span class="variation3">u</span>re, the archangels' a<span class="variation3">u</span>tobiographies, the faithf<span class="variation3">u</span>l catalog<span class="variation3">u</span>es of the Library, tho<span class="variation3">u</span>sands and tho<span class="variation3">u</span>sands of false catalog<span class="variation3">u</span>es, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalog<span class="variation3">u</span>es, the demonstration of the fallacy of the tr<span class="variation3">u</span>e catalog<span class="variation3">u</span>e, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the tr<span class="variation3">u</span>e story of yo<span class="variation3">u</span>r death, the translation of every book in all lang<span class="variation3">u</span>ages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treas<span class="variation3">u</span>re. There was no personal or world problem whose eloq<span class="variation3">u</span>ent sol<span class="variation3">u</span>tion did not exist in some hexagon. The <span class="variation3">u</span>niverse was j<span class="variation3">u</span>stified, the <span class="variation3">u</span>niverse s<span class="variation3">u</span>ddenly <span class="variation3">u</span>s<span class="variation3">u</span>rped the <span class="variation3">u</span>nlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said abo<span class="variation3">u</span>t the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the <span class="variation3">u</span>niverse and retained prodigio<span class="variation3">u</span>s arcana for his f<span class="variation3">u</span>t<span class="variation3">u</span>re. Tho<span class="variation3">u</span>sands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and r<span class="variation3">u</span>shed <span class="variation3">u</span>p the stairways, <span class="variation3">u</span>rged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disp<span class="variation3">u</span>ted in the narrow corridors, proferred dark c<span class="variation3">u</span>rses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, fl<span class="variation3">u</span>ng the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the f<span class="variation3">u</span>t<span class="variation3">u</span>re, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) b<span class="variation3">u</span>t the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treachero<span class="variation3">u</span>s variation thereof, can be comp<span class="variation3">u</span>ted as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of h<span class="variation3">u</span>manity's basic mysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be fo<span class="variation3">u</span>nd. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries co<span class="variation3">u</span>ld be explained in words: if the lang<span class="variation3">u</span>age of philosophers is not s<span class="variation3">u</span>fficient, the m<span class="variation3">u</span>ltiform Library will have prod<span class="variation3">u</span>ced the <span class="variation3">u</span>nprecedented lang<span class="variation3">u</span>age req<span class="variation3">u</span>ired, with its vocab<span class="variation3">u</span>laries and grammars. For fo<span class="variation3">u</span>r cent<span class="variation3">u</span>ries now men have exha<span class="variation3">u</span>sted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inq<span class="variation3">u</span>isitors. I have seen them in the performance of their f<span class="variation3">u</span>nction: they always arrive extremely tired from their jo<span class="variation3">u</span>rneys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick <span class="variation3">u</span>p the nearest vol<span class="variation3">u</span>me and leaf thro<span class="variation3">u</span>gh it, looking for infamo<span class="variation3">u</span>s words. Obvio<span class="variation3">u</span>sly, no one expects to discover anything.
      <br><br>
      As was nat<span class="variation3">u</span>ral, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression. The certit<span class="variation3">u</span>de that some shelf in some hexagon held precio<span class="variation3">u</span>s books and that these precio<span class="variation3">u</span>s books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemo<span class="variation3">u</span>s sect s<span class="variation3">u</span>ggested that the searches sho<span class="variation3">u</span>ld cease and that all men sho<span class="variation3">u</span>ld j<span class="variation3">u</span>ggle letters and symbols <span class="variation3">u</span>ntil they constr<span class="variation3">u</span>cted, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The a<span class="variation3">u</span>thorities were obliged to iss<span class="variation3">u</span>e severe orders. The sect disappeared, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, wo<span class="variation3">u</span>ld hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice c<span class="variation3">u</span>p and feebly mimic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, believed that it was f<span class="variation3">u</span>ndamental to eliminate <span class="variation3">u</span>seless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed thro<span class="variation3">u</span>gh a vol<span class="variation3">u</span>me with displeas<span class="variation3">u</span>re and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic f<span class="variation3">u</span>ror ca<span class="variation3">u</span>sed the senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t those who deplore the "treas<span class="variation3">u</span>res" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormo<span class="variation3">u</span>s that any red<span class="variation3">u</span>ction of h<span class="variation3">u</span>man origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is <span class="variation3">u</span>niq<span class="variation3">u</span>e, irreplaceable, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t (since the Library is total) there are always several h<span class="variation3">u</span>ndred tho<span class="variation3">u</span>sand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Co<span class="variation3">u</span>nter to general opinion, I vent<span class="variation3">u</span>re to s<span class="variation3">u</span>ppose that the conseq<span class="variation3">u</span>ences of the P<span class="variation3">u</span>rifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics prod<span class="variation3">u</span>ced. They were <span class="variation3">u</span>rged on by the deliri<span class="variation3">u</span>m of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than <span class="variation3">u</span>s<span class="variation3">u</span>al, all-powerf<span class="variation3">u</span>l, ill<span class="variation3">u</span>strated and magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another s<span class="variation3">u</span>perstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there m<span class="variation3">u</span>st exist a book which is the form<span class="variation3">u</span>la and perfect compendi<span class="variation3">u</span>m of all the rest: some librarian has gone thro<span class="variation3">u</span>gh it and he is analogo<span class="variation3">u</span>s to a god. In the lang<span class="variation3">u</span>age of this zone vestiges of this remote f<span class="variation3">u</span>nctionary's c<span class="variation3">u</span>lt still persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a cent<span class="variation3">u</span>ry they have exha<span class="variation3">u</span>sted in vain the most varied areas. How co<span class="variation3">u</span>ld one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which ho<span class="variation3">u</span>sed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, cons<span class="variation3">u</span>lt first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, cons<span class="variation3">u</span>lt first a book C, and so on to infinity... In advent<span class="variation3">u</span>res s<span class="variation3">u</span>ch as these, I have sq<span class="variation3">u</span>andered and wasted my years. It does not seem <span class="variation3">u</span>nlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the <span class="variation3">u</span>niverse (3) ; I pray to the <span class="variation3">u</span>nknown gods that a man - j<span class="variation3">u</span>st one, even tho<span class="variation3">u</span>gh it were tho<span class="variation3">u</span>sands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, tho<span class="variation3">u</span>gh my place be in hell. Let me be o<span class="variation3">u</span>traged and annihilated, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t for one instant, in one being, let Yo<span class="variation3">u</span>r enormo<span class="variation3">u</span>s Library be j<span class="variation3">u</span>stified. The impio<span class="variation3">u</span>s maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even h<span class="variation3">u</span>mble and p<span class="variation3">u</span>re coherence) is an almost mirac<span class="variation3">u</span>lo<span class="variation3">u</span>s exception. They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance vol<span class="variation3">u</span>mes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and conf<span class="variation3">u</span>se everything like a delirio<span class="variation3">u</span>s divinity." These words, which not only deno<span class="variation3">u</span>nce the disorder b<span class="variation3">u</span>t exemplify it as well, notorio<span class="variation3">u</span>sly prove their a<span class="variation3">u</span>thors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In tr<span class="variation3">u</span>th, the Library incl<span class="variation3">u</span>des all verbal str<span class="variation3">u</span>ct<span class="variation3">u</span>res, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t not a single example of absol<span class="variation3">u</span>te nonsense. It is <span class="variation3">u</span>seless to observe that the best vol<span class="variation3">u</span>me of the many hexagons <span class="variation3">u</span>nder my administration is entitled The Combed Th<span class="variation3">u</span>nderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no do<span class="variation3">u</span>bt be j<span class="variation3">u</span>stified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; s<span class="variation3">u</span>ch a j<span class="variation3">u</span>stification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already fig<span class="variation3">u</span>res in the Library. I cannot combine some characters
      <br><br>
      dhcmrlchtdj
      <br><br>
      which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tong<span class="variation3">u</span>es do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can artic<span class="variation3">u</span>late a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these lang<span class="variation3">u</span>ages, the powerf<span class="variation3">u</span>l name of a god. To speak is to fall into ta<span class="variation3">u</span>tology. This wordy and <span class="variation3">u</span>seless epistle already exists in one of the thirty vol<span class="variation3">u</span>mes of the five shelves of one of the inn<span class="variation3">u</span>merable hexagons - and its ref<span class="variation3">u</span>tation as well. (An n n<span class="variation3">u</span>mber of possible lang<span class="variation3">u</span>ages <span class="variation3">u</span>se the same vocab<span class="variation3">u</span>lary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a <span class="variation3">u</span>biq<span class="variation3">u</span>ito<span class="variation3">u</span>s and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another val<span class="variation3">u</span>e. Yo<span class="variation3">u</span> who read me, are Yo<span class="variation3">u</span> s<span class="variation3">u</span>re of <span class="variation3">u</span>nderstanding my lang<span class="variation3">u</span>age?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certit<span class="variation3">u</span>de that everything has been written negates <span class="variation3">u</span>s or t<span class="variation3">u</span>rns <span class="variation3">u</span>s into phantoms. I know of districts in which the yo<span class="variation3">u</span>ng men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbaro<span class="variation3">u</span>s manner, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the pop<span class="variation3">u</span>lation. I believe I have mentioned s<span class="variation3">u</span>icides, more and more freq<span class="variation3">u</span>ent with the years. Perhaps my old age and fearf<span class="variation3">u</span>lness deceive me, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t I s<span class="variation3">u</span>spect that the h<span class="variation3">u</span>man species - the <span class="variation3">u</span>niq<span class="variation3">u</span>e species - is abo<span class="variation3">u</span>t to be exting<span class="variation3">u</span>ished, b<span class="variation3">u</span>t the Library will end<span class="variation3">u</span>re: ill<span class="variation3">u</span>minated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, eq<span class="variation3">u</span>ipped with precio<span class="variation3">u</span>s vol<span class="variation3">u</span>mes, <span class="variation3">u</span>seless, incorr<span class="variation3">u</span>ptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have j<span class="variation3">u</span>st written the word "infinite".' I have not interpolated this adjective o<span class="variation3">u</span>t of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those who j<span class="variation3">u</span>dge it to be limited post<span class="variation3">u</span>late that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is abs<span class="variation3">u</span>rd. Those who imagine it to be witho<span class="variation3">u</span>t limit forget that the possible n<span class="variation3">u</span>mber of books does have s<span class="variation3">u</span>ch a limit. I vent<span class="variation3">u</span>re to s<span class="variation3">u</span>ggest this sol<span class="variation3">u</span>tion to the ancient problem: The Library is <span class="variation3">u</span>nlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after cent<span class="variation3">u</span>ries he wo<span class="variation3">u</span>ld see that the same vol<span class="variation3">u</span>mes were repeated in the same disorder (which, th<span class="variation3">u</span>s repeated, wo<span class="variation3">u</span>ld be an order: the Order). My solit<span class="variation3">u</span>de is gladdened by this elegant hope (4).

      1. The original man<span class="variation3">u</span>script does not contain digits or capital letters. The p<span class="variation3">u</span>nct<span class="variation3">u</span>ation has been limited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the twenty-five symbols considered s<span class="variation3">u</span>fficient by this <span class="variation3">u</span>nknown a<span class="variation3">u</span>thor. (Editor's note.)

      2. Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. S<span class="variation3">u</span>icide and p<span class="variation3">u</span>lmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of <span class="variation3">u</span>nspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for many nights thro<span class="variation3">u</span>gh corridors and along polished stairways witho<span class="variation3">u</span>t finding a single librarian.
      <br><br>
      3. I repeat: it s<span class="variation3">u</span>ffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excl<span class="variation3">u</span>ded. For example: no book can be a ladder, altho<span class="variation3">u</span>gh no do<span class="variation3">u</span>bt there are books which disc<span class="variation3">u</span>ss and negate and demonstrate this possibility and others whose str<span class="variation3">u</span>ct<span class="variation3">u</span>re corresponds to that of a ladder.

      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is <span class="variation3">u</span>seless: rigoro<span class="variation3">u</span>sly speaking, a single vol<span class="variation3">u</span>me wo<span class="variation3">u</span>ld be s<span class="variation3">u</span>fficient, a vol<span class="variation3">u</span>me of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite n<span class="variation3">u</span>mber if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth cent<span class="variation3">u</span>ry, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the s<span class="variation3">u</span>perimposition of an infinite n<span class="variation3">u</span>mber of planes.) The handling of this silky vade mec<span class="variation3">u</span>m wo<span class="variation3">u</span>ld not be convenient: each apparent page wo<span class="variation3">u</span>ld <span class="variation3">u</span>nfold into other analogo<span class="variation3">u</span>s ones; the inconceivable middle page wo<span class="variation3">u</span>ld have no reverse.
