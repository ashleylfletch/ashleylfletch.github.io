      The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>onal <span class="variation1">g</span>alleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railin<span class="variation1">g</span>s. From any of the hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the <span class="variation1">g</span>alleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five lon<span class="variation1">g</span> shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their hei<span class="variation1">g</span>ht, which is the distance from floor to ceilin<span class="variation1">g</span>, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another <span class="variation1">g</span>allery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and ri<span class="variation1">g</span>ht of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standin<span class="variation1">g</span> up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also throu<span class="variation1">g</span>h here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Li<span class="variation1">g</span>ht is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on. The li<span class="variation1">g</span>ht they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalo<span class="variation1">g</span>ue of catalo<span class="variation1">g</span>ues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparin<span class="variation1">g</span> to die just a few lea<span class="variation1">g</span>ues from the hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railin<span class="variation1">g</span>; my <span class="variation1">g</span>rave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind <span class="variation1">g</span>enerated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unendin<span class="variation1">g</span>. The idealists ar<span class="variation1">g</span>ue that the hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>onal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a trian<span class="variation1">g</span>ular or penta<span class="variation1">g</span>onal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containin<span class="variation1">g</span> a <span class="variation1">g</span>reat circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is <span class="variation1">G</span>od.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons and whose circumference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pa<span class="variation1">g</span>es; each pa<span class="variation1">g</span>e, of forty lines, each line, of some ei<span class="variation1">g</span>hty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefi<span class="variation1">g</span>ure what the pa<span class="variation1">g</span>es will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizin<span class="variation1">g</span> the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tra<span class="variation1">g</span>ic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiur<span class="variation1">g</span>i; the universe, with its ele<span class="variation1">g</span>ant endowment of shelves, of eni<span class="variation1">g</span>matical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a <span class="variation1">g</span>od. To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enou<span class="variation1">g</span>h to compare these crude waverin<span class="variation1">g</span> symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the or<span class="variation1">g</span>anic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The ortho<span class="variation1">g</span>raphical symbols are twenty-five in number.^ This findin<span class="variation1">g</span> made it possible, three hundred years a<span class="variation1">g</span>o, to formulate a <span class="variation1">g</span>eneral theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last pa<span class="variation1">g</span>e says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of strai<span class="variation1">g</span>htforward statement, there are lea<span class="variation1">g</span>ues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth re<span class="variation1">g</span>ion whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of findin<span class="variation1">g</span> a meanin<span class="variation1">g</span> in books and equate it with that of findin<span class="variation1">g</span> a meanin<span class="variation1">g</span> in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that the inventors of this writin<span class="variation1">g</span> imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books si<span class="variation1">g</span>nify nothin<span class="variation1">g</span> in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a lon<span class="variation1">g</span> time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>es. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>e quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the ri<span class="variation1">g</span>ht the ton<span class="variation1">g</span>ue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pa<span class="variation1">g</span>es of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>e, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the followin<span class="variation1">g</span> one and that the value of MCV in the third line of pa<span class="variation1">g</span>e 7 (1) was not the one the same series may have in another position on another pa<span class="variation1">g</span>e, but this va<span class="variation1">g</span>ue thesis did not prevail. Others thou<span class="variation1">g</span>ht of crypto<span class="variation1">g</span>raphs; <span class="variation1">g</span>enerally, this conjecture has been accepted, thou<span class="variation1">g</span>h not in the sense in which it was formulated by its ori<span class="variation1">g</span>inators.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred years a<span class="variation1">g</span>o, the chief of an upper hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on (2) came upon a book as confusin<span class="variation1">g</span> as the others, but which had nearly two pa<span class="variation1">g</span>es of homo<span class="variation1">g</span>eneous lines. He showed his find to a wanderin<span class="variation1">g</span> decoder who told him the lines were written in Portu<span class="variation1">g</span>uese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>e was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of <span class="variation1">G</span>uarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of <span class="variation1">g</span>enius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they mi<span class="variation1">g</span>ht be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alle<span class="variation1">g</span>ed a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves re<span class="variation1">g</span>ister all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd ortho<span class="variation1">g</span>raphical symbols (a number which, thou<span class="variation1">g</span>h extremely vast, is not infinite): Everythin<span class="variation1">g</span>: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archan<span class="variation1">g</span>els' autobio<span class="variation1">g</span>raphies, the faithful catalo<span class="variation1">g</span>ues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalo<span class="variation1">g</span>ues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalo<span class="variation1">g</span>ues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalo<span class="variation1">g</span>ue, the <span class="variation1">G</span>nostic <span class="variation1">g</span>ospel of Basilides, the commentary on that <span class="variation1">g</span>ospel, the commentary on the commentary on that <span class="variation1">g</span>ospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>es, the interpolations of every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extrava<span class="variation1">g</span>ant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a <span class="variation1">g</span>reat deal was said about the Vindications: books of apolo<span class="variation1">g</span>y and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodi<span class="variation1">g</span>ious arcana for his future. Thousands of the <span class="variation1">g</span>reedy abandoned their sweet native hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons and rushed up the stairways, ur<span class="variation1">g</span>ed on by the vain intention of findin<span class="variation1">g</span> their Vindication. These pil<span class="variation1">g</span>rims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, stran<span class="variation1">g</span>led each other on the divine stairways, flun<span class="variation1">g</span> the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote re<span class="variation1">g</span>ions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not ima<span class="variation1">g</span>inary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's findin<span class="variation1">g</span> his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic mysteries - the ori<span class="variation1">g</span>in of the Library and of time - mi<span class="variation1">g</span>ht be found. It is verisimilar that these <span class="variation1">g</span>rave mysteries could be explained in words: if the lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>e of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>e required, with its vocabularies and <span class="variation1">g</span>rammars. For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of <span class="variation1">g</span>alleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf throu<span class="variation1">g</span>h it, lookin<span class="variation1">g</span> for infamous words. Obviously, no one expects to discover anythin<span class="variation1">g</span>.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect su<span class="variation1">g</span><span class="variation1">g</span>ested that the searches should cease and that all men should ju<span class="variation1">g</span><span class="variation1">g</span>le letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable <span class="variation1">g</span>ift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obli<span class="variation1">g</span>ed to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for lon<span class="variation1">g</span> periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed throu<span class="variation1">g</span>h a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their hy<span class="variation1">g</span>ienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy ne<span class="variation1">g</span>lect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human ori<span class="variation1">g</span>in is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to <span class="variation1">g</span>eneral opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exa<span class="variation1">g</span><span class="variation1">g</span>erated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were ur<span class="variation1">g</span>ed on by the delirium of tryin<span class="variation1">g</span> to reach the books in the Crimson Hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and ma<span class="variation1">g</span>ical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has <span class="variation1">g</span>one throu<span class="variation1">g</span>h it and he is analo<span class="variation1">g</span>ous to a <span class="variation1">g</span>od. In the lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>e of this zone vesti<span class="variation1">g</span>es of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>on which housed Him? Someone proposed a re<span class="variation1">g</span>ressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe (3) ; I pray to the unknown <span class="variation1">g</span>ods that a man - just one, even thou<span class="variation1">g</span>h it were thousands of years a<span class="variation1">g</span>o! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, thou<span class="variation1">g</span>h my place be in hell. Let me be outra<span class="variation1">g</span>ed and annihilated, but for one instant, in one bein<span class="variation1">g</span>, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in dan<span class="variation1">g</span>er of chan<span class="variation1">g</span>in<span class="variation1">g</span> into others and affirm, ne<span class="variation1">g</span>ate and confuse everythin<span class="variation1">g</span> like a delirious divinity." These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate i<span class="variation1">g</span>norance. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five ortho<span class="variation1">g</span>raphical symbols, but not a sin<span class="variation1">g</span>le example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first <span class="variation1">g</span>lance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a crypto<span class="variation1">g</span>raphical or alle<span class="variation1">g</span>orical manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already fi<span class="variation1">g</span>ures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret ton<span class="variation1">g</span>ues do not contain a terrible meanin<span class="variation1">g</span>. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>es, the powerful name of a <span class="variation1">g</span>od. To speak is to fall into tautolo<span class="variation1">g</span>y. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of possible lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>es use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lastin<span class="variation1">g</span> system of hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>onal <span class="variation1">g</span>alleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anythin<span class="variation1">g</span> else, and these seven words which define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of understandin<span class="variation1">g</span> my lan<span class="variation1">g</span>ua<span class="variation1">g</span>e?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of writin<span class="variation1">g</span> distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that everythin<span class="variation1">g</span> has been written ne<span class="variation1">g</span>ates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the youn<span class="variation1">g</span> men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pa<span class="variation1">g</span>es in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a sin<span class="variation1">g</span>le letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, pere<span class="variation1">g</span>rinations which inevitably de<span class="variation1">g</span>enerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old a<span class="variation1">g</span>e and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extin<span class="variation1">g</span>uished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the word "infinite".' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illo<span class="variation1">g</span>ical to think that the world is infinite. Those who jud<span class="variation1">g</span>e it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd. Those who ima<span class="variation1">g</span>ine it to be without limit for<span class="variation1">g</span>et that the possible number of books does have such a limit. I venture to su<span class="variation1">g</span><span class="variation1">g</span>est this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is <span class="variation1">g</span>laddened by this ele<span class="variation1">g</span>ant hope (4).
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      The ori<span class="variation1">g</span>inal manuscript does not contain di<span class="variation1">g</span>its or capital letters. The punctuation has been limited to the comma and the period. These two si<span class="variation1">g</span>ns, the space and the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the twenty-five symbols considered sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's note.)
      <br><br>
      2. Before, there was a man for every three hexa<span class="variation1">g</span>ons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for many ni<span class="variation1">g</span>hts throu<span class="variation1">g</span>h corridors and alon<span class="variation1">g</span> polished stairways without findin<span class="variation1">g</span> a sin<span class="variation1">g</span>le librarian.
      <br><br>
      3. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, althou<span class="variation1">g</span>h no doubt there are books which discuss and ne<span class="variation1">g</span>ate and demonstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.
      <br><br>
      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: ri<span class="variation1">g</span>orously speakin<span class="variation1">g</span>, a sin<span class="variation1">g</span>le volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containin<span class="variation1">g</span> an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handlin<span class="variation1">g</span> of this silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent pa<span class="variation1">g</span>e would unfold into other analo<span class="variation1">g</span>ous ones; the inconceivable middle pa<span class="variation1">g</span>e would have no reverse.
