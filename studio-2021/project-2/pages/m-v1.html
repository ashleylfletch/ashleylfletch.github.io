      The Anato<span class="variation1">m</span>y of <span class="variation1">M</span>elancholy, part 2, sect. II, <span class="variation1">m</span>e<span class="variation1">m</span>. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which others call the Library) is co<span class="variation1">m</span>posed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite nu<span class="variation1">m</span>ber of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. Fro<span class="variation1">m</span> any of the hexagons one can see, inter<span class="variation1">m</span>inably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance fro<span class="variation1">m</span> floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a nor<span class="variation1">m</span>al bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very s<span class="variation1">m</span>all closets. In the first, one <span class="variation1">m</span>ay sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abys<span class="variation1">m</span>ally and soars upwards to re<span class="variation1">m</span>ote distances. In the hallway there is a <span class="variation1">m</span>irror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. <span class="variation1">M</span>en usually infer fro<span class="variation1">m</span> this <span class="variation1">m</span>irror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to drea<span class="variation1">m</span> that its polished surfaces represent and pro<span class="variation1">m</span>ise the infinite... Light is provided by so<span class="variation1">m</span>e spherical fruit which bear the na<span class="variation1">m</span>e of la<span class="variation1">m</span>ps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they e<span class="variation1">m</span>it is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all <span class="variation1">m</span>en of the Library, I have traveled in <span class="variation1">m</span>y youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that <span class="variation1">m</span>y eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I a<span class="variation1">m</span> preparing to die just a few leagues fro<span class="variation1">m</span> the hexagon in which I was born. Once I a<span class="variation1">m</span> dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw <span class="variation1">m</span>e over the railing; <span class="variation1">m</span>y grave will be the fatho<span class="variation1">m</span>less air; <span class="variation1">m</span>y body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal roo<span class="variation1">m</span>s are a necessary for<span class="variation1">m</span> of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal roo<span class="variation1">m</span> is inconceivable. (The <span class="variation1">m</span>ystics clai<span class="variation1">m</span> that their ecstasy reveals to the<span class="variation1">m</span> a circular cha<span class="variation1">m</span>ber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the co<span class="variation1">m</span>plete circle of the walls; but their testi<span class="variation1">m</span>ony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for <span class="variation1">m</span>e to repeat the classic dictu<span class="variation1">m</span>: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circu<span class="variation1">m</span>ference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of unifor<span class="variation1">m</span> for<span class="variation1">m</span>at; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of so<span class="variation1">m</span>e eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e see<span class="variation1">m</span>ed <span class="variation1">m</span>ysterious. Before su<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>arizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axio<span class="variation1">m</span>s.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose i<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>ediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable <span class="variation1">m</span>ind. <span class="variation1">M</span>an, the i<span class="variation1">m</span>perfect librarian, <span class="variation1">m</span>ay be the product of chance or of <span class="variation1">m</span>alevolent de<span class="variation1">m</span>iurgi; the universe, with its elegant endow<span class="variation1">m</span>ent of shelves, of enig<span class="variation1">m</span>atical volu<span class="variation1">m</span>es, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the hu<span class="variation1">m</span>an, it is enough to co<span class="variation1">m</span>pare these crude wavering sy<span class="variation1">m</span>bols which <span class="variation1">m</span>y fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, ini<span class="variation1">m</span>itably sy<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>etrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthographical sy<span class="variation1">m</span>bols are twenty-five in nu<span class="variation1">m</span>ber. ^ This finding <span class="variation1">m</span>ade it possible, three hundred years ago, to for<span class="variation1">m</span>ulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the proble<span class="variation1">m</span> which no conjecture had deciphered: the for<span class="variation1">m</span>less and chaotic nature of al<span class="variation1">m</span>ost all the books. One which <span class="variation1">m</span>y father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was <span class="variation1">m</span>ade up of the letters <span class="variation1">M</span>CV, perversely repeated fro<span class="variation1">m</span> the first line to the last. Another (very <span class="variation1">m</span>uch consulted in this area) is a <span class="variation1">m</span>ere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e thy pyra<span class="variation1">m</span>ids. This <span class="variation1">m</span>uch is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward state<span class="variation1">m</span>ent, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal ju<span class="variation1">m</span>bles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custo<span class="variation1">m</span> of finding a <span class="variation1">m</span>eaning in books and equate it with that of finding a <span class="variation1">m</span>eaning in drea<span class="variation1">m</span>s or in the chaotic lines of one's pal<span class="variation1">m</span>... They ad<span class="variation1">m</span>it that the inventors of this writing i<span class="variation1">m</span>itated the twenty-five natural sy<span class="variation1">m</span>bols, but <span class="variation1">m</span>aintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in the<span class="variation1">m</span>selves. This dictu<span class="variation1">m</span>, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e it was believed that these i<span class="variation1">m</span>penetrable books corresponded to past or re<span class="variation1">m</span>ote languages. It is true that the <span class="variation1">m</span>ost ancient <span class="variation1">m</span>en, the first librarians, used a language quite different fro<span class="variation1">m</span> the one we now speak; it is true that a few <span class="variation1">m</span>iles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is inco<span class="variation1">m</span>prehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable <span class="variation1">M</span>CV's cannot correspond to any language, no <span class="variation1">m</span>atter how dialectical or rudi<span class="variation1">m</span>entary it <span class="variation1">m</span>ay be. So<span class="variation1">m</span>e insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of <span class="variation1">M</span>CV in the third line of page 7 (1) was not the one the sa<span class="variation1">m</span>e series <span class="variation1">m</span>ay have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was for<span class="variation1">m</span>ulated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon (2) ca<span class="variation1">m</span>e upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of ho<span class="variation1">m</span>ogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told hi<span class="variation1">m</span> the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Sa<span class="variation1">m</span>oyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: so<span class="variation1">m</span>e notions of co<span class="variation1">m</span>binative analysis, illustrated with exa<span class="variation1">m</span>ples of variations with unli<span class="variation1">m</span>ited repetition. These exa<span class="variation1">m</span>ples <span class="variation1">m</span>ade it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the funda<span class="variation1">m</span>ental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no <span class="variation1">m</span>atter how diverse they <span class="variation1">m</span>ight be, are <span class="variation1">m</span>ade up of the sa<span class="variation1">m</span>e ele<span class="variation1">m</span>ents: the space, the period, the co<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>a, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confir<span class="variation1">m</span>ed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. Fro<span class="variation1">m</span> these two incontrovertible pre<span class="variation1">m</span>ises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible co<span class="variation1">m</span>binations of the twenty-odd orthographical sy<span class="variation1">m</span>bols (a nu<span class="variation1">m</span>ber which, though extre<span class="variation1">m</span>ely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the <span class="variation1">m</span>inutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the de<span class="variation1">m</span>onstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the de<span class="variation1">m</span>onstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the co<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>entary on that gospel, the co<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>entary on the co<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>entary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was proclai<span class="variation1">m</span>ed that the Library contained all books, the first i<span class="variation1">m</span>pression was one of extravagant happiness. All <span class="variation1">m</span>en felt the<span class="variation1">m</span>selves to be the <span class="variation1">m</span>asters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world proble<span class="variation1">m</span> whose eloquent solution did not exist in so<span class="variation1">m</span>e hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unli<span class="variation1">m</span>ited di<span class="variation1">m</span>ensions of hope. At that ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e the acts of every <span class="variation1">m</span>an in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pilgri<span class="variation1">m</span>s disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive books into the air shafts, <span class="variation1">m</span>et their death cast down in a si<span class="variation1">m</span>ilar fashion by the inhabitants of re<span class="variation1">m</span>ote regions. Others went <span class="variation1">m</span>ad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not i<span class="variation1">m</span>aginary) but the searchers did not re<span class="variation1">m</span>e<span class="variation1">m</span>ber that the possibility of a <span class="variation1">m</span>an's finding his Vindication, or so<span class="variation1">m</span>e treacherous variation thereof, can be co<span class="variation1">m</span>puted as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e it was also hoped that a clarification of hu<span class="variation1">m</span>anity's basic <span class="variation1">m</span>ysteries - the origin of the Library and of ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e - <span class="variation1">m</span>ight be found. It is verisi<span class="variation1">m</span>ilar that these grave <span class="variation1">m</span>ysteries could be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the <span class="variation1">m</span>ultifor<span class="variation1">m</span> Library will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and gra<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>ars. For four centuries now <span class="variation1">m</span>en have exhausted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen the<span class="variation1">m</span> in the perfor<span class="variation1">m</span>ance of their function: they always arrive extre<span class="variation1">m</span>ely tired fro<span class="variation1">m</span> their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which al<span class="variation1">m</span>ost killed the<span class="variation1">m</span>; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; so<span class="variation1">m</span>eti<span class="variation1">m</span>es they pick up the nearest volu<span class="variation1">m</span>e and leaf through it, looking for infa<span class="variation1">m</span>ous words. Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression. The certitude that so<span class="variation1">m</span>e shelf in so<span class="variation1">m</span>e hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, see<span class="variation1">m</span>ed al<span class="variation1">m</span>ost intolerable. A blasphe<span class="variation1">m</span>ous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all <span class="variation1">m</span>en should juggle letters and sy<span class="variation1">m</span>bols until they constructed, by an i<span class="variation1">m</span>probable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in <span class="variation1">m</span>y childhood I have seen old <span class="variation1">m</span>en who, for long periods of ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e, would hide in the latrines with so<span class="variation1">m</span>e <span class="variation1">m</span>etal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly <span class="variation1">m</span>i<span class="variation1">m</span>ic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, believed that it was funda<span class="variation1">m</span>ental to eli<span class="variation1">m</span>inate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volu<span class="variation1">m</span>e with displeasure and conde<span class="variation1">m</span>ned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of <span class="variation1">m</span>illions of books. Their na<span class="variation1">m</span>e is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enor<span class="variation1">m</span>ous that any reduction of hu<span class="variation1">m</span>an origin is infinitesi<span class="variation1">m</span>al. The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand i<span class="variation1">m</span>perfect facsi<span class="variation1">m</span>iles: works which differ only in a letter or a co<span class="variation1">m</span><span class="variation1">m</span>a. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on by the deliriu<span class="variation1">m</span> of trying to reach the books in the Cri<span class="variation1">m</span>son Hexagon: books whose for<span class="variation1">m</span>at is s<span class="variation1">m</span>aller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and <span class="variation1">m</span>agical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another superstition of that ti<span class="variation1">m</span>e: that of the <span class="variation1">M</span>an of the Book. On so<span class="variation1">m</span>e shelf in so<span class="variation1">m</span>e hexagon (<span class="variation1">m</span>en reasoned) there <span class="variation1">m</span>ust exist a book which is the for<span class="variation1">m</span>ula and perfect co<span class="variation1">m</span>pendiu<span class="variation1">m</span> of all the rest: so<span class="variation1">m</span>e librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this re<span class="variation1">m</span>ote functionary's cult still persist. <span class="variation1">M</span>any wandered in search of Hi<span class="variation1">m</span>. For a century they have exhausted in vain the <span class="variation1">m</span>ost varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Hi<span class="variation1">m</span>? So<span class="variation1">m</span>eone proposed a regressive <span class="variation1">m</span>ethod: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted <span class="variation1">m</span>y years. It does not see<span class="variation1">m</span> unlikely to <span class="variation1">m</span>e that there is a total book on so<span class="variation1">m</span>e shelf of the universe (3) ; I pray to the unknown gods that a <span class="variation1">m</span>an - just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! - <span class="variation1">m</span>ay have exa<span class="variation1">m</span>ined and read it. If honor and wisdo<span class="variation1">m</span> and happiness are not for <span class="variation1">m</span>e, let the<span class="variation1">m</span> be for others. Let heaven exist, though <span class="variation1">m</span>y place be in hell. Let <span class="variation1">m</span>e be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enor<span class="variation1">m</span>ous Library be justified. The i<span class="variation1">m</span>pious <span class="variation1">m</span>aintain that nonsense is nor<span class="variation1">m</span>al in the Library and that the reasonable (and even hu<span class="variation1">m</span>ble and pure coherence) is an al<span class="variation1">m</span>ost <span class="variation1">m</span>iraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volu<span class="variation1">m</span>es are constantly in danger of changing into others and affir<span class="variation1">m</span>, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity." These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exe<span class="variation1">m</span>plify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abo<span class="variation1">m</span>inable taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations per<span class="variation1">m</span>itted by the twenty-five orthographical sy<span class="variation1">m</span>bols, but not a single exa<span class="variation1">m</span>ple of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volu<span class="variation1">m</span>e of the <span class="variation1">m</span>any hexagons under <span class="variation1">m</span>y ad<span class="variation1">m</span>inistration is entitled The Co<span class="variation1">m</span>bed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cra<span class="variation1">m</span>p and another Axaxaxas <span class="variation1">m</span>lo. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical <span class="variation1">m</span>anner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I cannot co<span class="variation1">m</span>bine so<span class="variation1">m</span>e characters
      <br><br>
      dhc<span class="variation1">m</span>rlchtdj
      <br><br>
      which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible <span class="variation1">m</span>eaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful na<span class="variation1">m</span>e of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volu<span class="variation1">m</span>es of the five shelves of one of the innu<span class="variation1">m</span>erable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n nu<span class="variation1">m</span>ber of possible languages use the sa<span class="variation1">m</span>e vocabulary; in so<span class="variation1">m</span>e of the<span class="variation1">m</span>, the sy<span class="variation1">m</span>bol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting syste<span class="variation1">m</span> of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyra<span class="variation1">m</span>id or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another value. You who read <span class="variation1">m</span>e, are You sure of understanding <span class="variation1">m</span>y language?)
      <br><br>
      The <span class="variation1">m</span>ethodical task of writing distracts <span class="variation1">m</span>e fro<span class="variation1">m</span> the present state of <span class="variation1">m</span>en. The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phanto<span class="variation1">m</span>s. I know of districts in which the young <span class="variation1">m</span>en prostrate the<span class="variation1">m</span>selves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous <span class="variation1">m</span>anner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epide<span class="variation1">m</span>ics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have deci<span class="variation1">m</span>ated the population. I believe I have <span class="variation1">m</span>entioned suicides, <span class="variation1">m</span>ore and <span class="variation1">m</span>ore frequent with the years. Perhaps <span class="variation1">m</span>y old age and fearfulness deceive <span class="variation1">m</span>e, but I suspect that the hu<span class="variation1">m</span>an species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illu<span class="variation1">m</span>inated, solitary, infinite, perfectly <span class="variation1">m</span>otionless, equipped with precious volu<span class="variation1">m</span>es, useless, incorruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the word "infinite".' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those who judge it to be li<span class="variation1">m</span>ited postulate that in re<span class="variation1">m</span>ote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably co<span class="variation1">m</span>e to an end - which is absurd. Those who i<span class="variation1">m</span>agine it to be without li<span class="variation1">m</span>it forget that the possible nu<span class="variation1">m</span>ber of books does have such a li<span class="variation1">m</span>it. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient proble<span class="variation1">m</span>: The Library is unli<span class="variation1">m</span>ited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the sa<span class="variation1">m</span>e volu<span class="variation1">m</span>es were repeated in the sa<span class="variation1">m</span>e disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). <span class="variation1">M</span>y solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope (4).

      3. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the i<span class="variation1">m</span>possible is excluded. For exa<span class="variation1">m</span>ple: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate and de<span class="variation1">m</span>onstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.

      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a single volu<span class="variation1">m</span>e would be sufficient, a volu<span class="variation1">m</span>e of ordinary for<span class="variation1">m</span>at, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite nu<span class="variation1">m</span>ber if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superi<span class="variation1">m</span>position of an infinite nu<span class="variation1">m</span>ber of planes.) The handling of this silky vade <span class="variation1">m</span>ecu<span class="variation1">m</span> would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold into other analogous ones; the inconceivable <span class="variation1">m</span>iddle page would have no reverse.
