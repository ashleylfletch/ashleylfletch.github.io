      The Anatomy of Melancholy, <span class="variation1">p</span>art 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which others call the Library) is com<span class="variation1">p</span>osed of an indefinite and <span class="variation1">p</span>erha<span class="variation1">p</span>s infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the u<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>er and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves <span class="variation1">p</span>er side, cover all the sides exce<span class="variation1">p</span>t two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which o<span class="variation1">p</span>ens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may slee<span class="variation1">p</span> standing u<span class="variation1">p</span>; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here <span class="variation1">p</span>asses a s<span class="variation1">p</span>iral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars u<span class="variation1">p</span>wards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully du<span class="variation1">p</span>licates all a<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>earances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory du<span class="variation1">p</span>lication?); I <span class="variation1">p</span>refer to dream that its <span class="variation1">p</span>olished surfaces re<span class="variation1">p</span>resent and <span class="variation1">p</span>romise the infinite... Light is <span class="variation1">p</span>rovided by some s<span class="variation1">p</span>herical fruit which bear the name of lam<span class="variation1">p</span>s. There are two, transversally <span class="variation1">p</span>laced, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, <span class="variation1">p</span>erha<span class="variation1">p</span>s the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly deci<span class="variation1">p</span>her what I write, I am <span class="variation1">p</span>re<span class="variation1">p</span>aring to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of <span class="variation1">p</span>ious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute s<span class="variation1">p</span>ace or, at least, of our intuition of s<span class="variation1">p</span>ace. They reason that a triangular or <span class="variation1">p</span>entagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose s<span class="variation1">p</span>ine is continuous and which follows the com<span class="variation1">p</span>lete circle of the walls; but their testimony is sus<span class="variation1">p</span>ect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to re<span class="variation1">p</span>eat the classic dictum: The Library is a s<span class="variation1">p</span>here whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten <span class="variation1">p</span>ages; each <span class="variation1">p</span>age, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the s<span class="variation1">p</span>ine of each book; these letters do not indicate or <span class="variation1">p</span>refigure what the <span class="variation1">p</span>ages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in s<span class="variation1">p</span>ite of its tragic <span class="variation1">p</span>rojections, is <span class="variation1">p</span>erha<span class="variation1">p</span>s the ca<span class="variation1">p</span>ital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot be <span class="variation1">p</span>laced in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the im<span class="variation1">p</span>erfect librarian, may be the <span class="variation1">p</span>roduct of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. To <span class="variation1">p</span>erceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to com<span class="variation1">p</span>are these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: <span class="variation1">p</span>unctual, delicate, <span class="variation1">p</span>erfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthogra<span class="variation1">p</span>hical symbols are twenty-five in number. ^ This finding made it <span class="variation1">p</span>ossible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the <span class="variation1">p</span>roblem which no conjecture had deci<span class="variation1">p</span>hered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made u<span class="variation1">p</span> of the letters MCV, <span class="variation1">p</span>erversely re<span class="variation1">p</span>eated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last <span class="variation1">p</span>age says Oh time thy <span class="variation1">p</span>yramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless caco<span class="variation1">p</span>honies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians re<span class="variation1">p</span>udiate the vain and su<span class="variation1">p</span>erstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's <span class="variation1">p</span>alm... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this a<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>lication is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it was believed that these im<span class="variation1">p</span>enetrable books corres<span class="variation1">p</span>onded to <span class="variation1">p</span>ast or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now s<span class="variation1">p</span>eak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther u<span class="variation1">p</span>, it is incom<span class="variation1">p</span>rehensible. All this, I re<span class="variation1">p</span>eat, is true, but four hundred and ten <span class="variation1">p</span>ages of inalterable MCV's cannot corres<span class="variation1">p</span>ond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of <span class="variation1">p</span>age 7 (1) was not the one the same series may have in another <span class="variation1">p</span>osition on another <span class="variation1">p</span>age, but this vague thesis did not <span class="variation1">p</span>revail. Others thought of cry<span class="variation1">p</span>togra<span class="variation1">p</span>hs; generally, this conjecture has been acce<span class="variation1">p</span>ted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred years ago, the chief of an u<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>er hexagon (2) came u<span class="variation1">p</span>on a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two <span class="variation1">p</span>ages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in <span class="variation1">P</span>ortuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deci<span class="variation1">p</span>hered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with exam<span class="variation1">p</span>les of variations with unlimited re<span class="variation1">p</span>etition. These exam<span class="variation1">p</span>les made it <span class="variation1">p</span>ossible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made u<span class="variation1">p</span> of the same elements: the s<span class="variation1">p</span>ace, the <span class="variation1">p</span>eriod, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the al<span class="variation1">p</span>habet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible <span class="variation1">p</span>remises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the <span class="variation1">p</span>ossible combinations of the twenty-odd orthogra<span class="variation1">p</span>hical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiogra<span class="variation1">p</span>hies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gos<span class="variation1">p</span>el of Basilides, the commentary on that gos<span class="variation1">p</span>el, the commentary on the commentary on that gos<span class="variation1">p</span>el, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the inter<span class="variation1">p</span>olations of every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was <span class="variation1">p</span>roclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first im<span class="variation1">p</span>ression was one of extravagant ha<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>iness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no <span class="variation1">p</span>ersonal or world <span class="variation1">p</span>roblem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usur<span class="variation1">p</span>ed the unlimited dimensions of ho<span class="variation1">p</span>e. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of a<span class="variation1">p</span>ology and <span class="variation1">p</span>ro<span class="variation1">p</span>hecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained <span class="variation1">p</span>rodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed u<span class="variation1">p</span> the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These <span class="variation1">p</span>ilgrims dis<span class="variation1">p</span>uted in the narrow corridors, <span class="variation1">p</span>roferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the dece<span class="variation1">p</span>tive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to <span class="variation1">p</span>ersons of the future, to <span class="variation1">p</span>ersons who are <span class="variation1">p</span>erha<span class="variation1">p</span>s not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the <span class="variation1">p</span>ossibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be com<span class="variation1">p</span>uted as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also ho<span class="variation1">p</span>ed that a clarification of humanity's basic mysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be ex<span class="variation1">p</span>lained in words: if the language of <span class="variation1">p</span>hiloso<span class="variation1">p</span>hers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have <span class="variation1">p</span>roduced the un<span class="variation1">p</span>recedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the <span class="variation1">p</span>erformance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they s<span class="variation1">p</span>eak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they <span class="variation1">p</span>ick u<span class="variation1">p</span> the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. Obviously, no one ex<span class="variation1">p</span>ects to discover anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inordinate ho<span class="variation1">p</span>e was followed by an excessive de<span class="variation1">p</span>ression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held <span class="variation1">p</span>recious books and that these <span class="variation1">p</span>recious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blas<span class="variation1">p</span>hemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an im<span class="variation1">p</span>robable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disa<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>eared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long <span class="variation1">p</span>eriods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cu<span class="variation1">p</span> and feebly mimic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with dis<span class="variation1">p</span>leasure and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless <span class="variation1">p</span>erdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who de<span class="variation1">p</span>lore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every co<span class="variation1">p</span>y is unique, irre<span class="variation1">p</span>laceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand im<span class="variation1">p</span>erfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general o<span class="variation1">p</span>inion, I venture to su<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>ose that the consequences of the <span class="variation1">P</span>urifiers' de<span class="variation1">p</span>redations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics <span class="variation1">p</span>roduced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-<span class="variation1">p</span>owerful, illustrated and magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another su<span class="variation1">p</span>erstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and <span class="variation1">p</span>erfect com<span class="variation1">p</span>endium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still <span class="variation1">p</span>ersist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone <span class="variation1">p</span>ro<span class="variation1">p</span>osed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's <span class="variation1">p</span>osition; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe (3) ; I <span class="variation1">p</span>ray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and ha<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>iness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my <span class="variation1">p</span>lace be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The im<span class="variation1">p</span>ious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and <span class="variation1">p</span>ure coherence) is an almost miraculous exce<span class="variation1">p</span>tion. They s<span class="variation1">p</span>eak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity." These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exem<span class="variation1">p</span>lify it as well, notoriously <span class="variation1">p</span>rove their authors' abominable taste and des<span class="variation1">p</span>erate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations <span class="variation1">p</span>ermitted by the twenty-five orthogra<span class="variation1">p</span>hical symbols, but not a single exam<span class="variation1">p</span>le of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thundercla<span class="variation1">p</span> and another The <span class="variation1">P</span>laster Cram<span class="variation1">p</span> and another Axaxaxas mlo. These <span class="variation1">p</span>hrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cry<span class="variation1">p</span>togra<span class="variation1">p</span>hical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hy<span class="variation1">p</span>othesi, already figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the <span class="variation1">p</span>owerful name of a god. To s<span class="variation1">p</span>eak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless e<span class="variation1">p</span>istle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of <span class="variation1">p</span>ossible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or <span class="variation1">p</span>yramid or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of writing distracts me from the <span class="variation1">p</span>resent state of men. The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into <span class="variation1">p</span>hantoms. I know of districts in which the young men <span class="variation1">p</span>rostrate themselves before books and kiss their <span class="variation1">p</span>ages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to deci<span class="variation1">p</span>her a single letter. E<span class="variation1">p</span>idemics, heretical conflicts, <span class="variation1">p</span>eregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the <span class="variation1">p</span>o<span class="variation1">p</span>ulation. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. <span class="variation1">P</span>erha<span class="variation1">p</span>s my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I sus<span class="variation1">p</span>ect that the human s<span class="variation1">p</span>ecies - the unique s<span class="variation1">p</span>ecies - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, <span class="variation1">p</span>erfectly motionless, equi<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>ed with <span class="variation1">p</span>recious volumes, useless, incorru<span class="variation1">p</span>tible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the word "infinite".' I have not inter<span class="variation1">p</span>olated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those who judge it to be limited <span class="variation1">p</span>ostulate that in remote <span class="variation1">p</span>laces the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the <span class="variation1">p</span>ossible number of books does have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient <span class="variation1">p</span>roblem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were re<span class="variation1">p</span>eated in the same disorder (which, thus re<span class="variation1">p</span>eated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant ho<span class="variation1">p</span>e (4).

      1. The original manuscri<span class="variation1">p</span>t does not contain digits or ca<span class="variation1">p</span>ital letters. The <span class="variation1">p</span>unctuation has been limited to the comma and the <span class="variation1">p</span>eriod. These two signs, the s<span class="variation1">p</span>ace and the twenty-two letters of the al<span class="variation1">p</span>habet are the twenty-five symbols considered sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's note.)

      2. Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and <span class="variation1">p</span>ulmonary diseases have destroyed that <span class="variation1">p</span>ro<span class="variation1">p</span>ortion. A memory of uns<span class="variation1">p</span>eakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for many nights through corridors and along <span class="variation1">p</span>olished stairways without finding a single librarian.
      <br><br>
      3. I re<span class="variation1">p</span>eat: it suffices that a book be <span class="variation1">p</span>ossible for it to exist. Only the im<span class="variation1">p</span>ossible is excluded. For exam<span class="variation1">p</span>le: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate and demonstrate this <span class="variation1">p</span>ossibility and others whose structure corres<span class="variation1">p</span>onds to that of a ladder.
      <br><br>
      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously s<span class="variation1">p</span>eaking, a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, <span class="variation1">p</span>rinted in nine or ten <span class="variation1">p</span>oint ty<span class="variation1">p</span>e, containing an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the su<span class="variation1">p</span>erim<span class="variation1">p</span>osition of an infinite number of <span class="variation1">p</span>lanes.) The handling of this silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each a<span class="variation1">p</span><span class="variation1">p</span>arent <span class="variation1">p</span>age would unfold into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle <span class="variation1">p</span>age would have no reverse.
