      T<span class="variation2">h</span>e Anatomy of Melanc<span class="variation2">h</span>oly, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      T<span class="variation2">h</span>e universe (w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers call t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library) is composed of an indefinite and per<span class="variation2">h</span>aps infinite number of <span class="variation2">h</span>exagonal galleries, wit<span class="variation2">h</span> vast air s<span class="variation2">h</span>afts between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons one can see, interminably, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e upper and lower floors. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e distribution of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e galleries is invariable. Twenty s<span class="variation2">h</span>elves, five long s<span class="variation2">h</span>elves per side, cover all t<span class="variation2">h</span>e sides except two; t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir <span class="variation2">h</span>eig<span class="variation2">h</span>t, w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> is t<span class="variation2">h</span>e distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds t<span class="variation2">h</span>at of a normal bookcase. One of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e free sides leads to a narrow <span class="variation2">h</span>allway w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> opens onto anot<span class="variation2">h</span>er gallery, identical to t<span class="variation2">h</span>e first and to all t<span class="variation2">h</span>e rest. To t<span class="variation2">h</span>e left and rig<span class="variation2">h</span>t of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>allway t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are two very small closets. In t<span class="variation2">h</span>e first, one may sleep standing up; in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e ot<span class="variation2">h</span>er, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also t<span class="variation2">h</span>roug<span class="variation2">h</span> <span class="variation2">h</span>ere passes a spiral stairway, w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>allway t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere is a mirror w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> fait<span class="variation2">h</span>fully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from t<span class="variation2">h</span>is mirror t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library is not infinite (if it were, w<span class="variation2">h</span>y t<span class="variation2">h</span>is illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream t<span class="variation2">h</span>at its polis<span class="variation2">h</span>ed surfaces represent and promise t<span class="variation2">h</span>e infinite... Lig<span class="variation2">h</span>t is provided by some sp<span class="variation2">h</span>erical fruit w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> bear t<span class="variation2">h</span>e name of lamps. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are two, transversally placed, in eac<span class="variation2">h</span> <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e lig<span class="variation2">h</span>t t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library, I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave traveled in my yout<span class="variation2">h</span>; I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave wandered in searc<span class="variation2">h</span> of a book, per<span class="variation2">h</span>aps t<span class="variation2">h</span>e catalogue of catalogues; now t<span class="variation2">h</span>at my eyes can <span class="variation2">h</span>ardly decip<span class="variation2">h</span>er w<span class="variation2">h</span>at I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon in w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> I was born. Once I am dead, t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere will be no lack of pious <span class="variation2">h</span>ands to t<span class="variation2">h</span>row me over t<span class="variation2">h</span>e railing; my grave will be t<span class="variation2">h</span>e fat<span class="variation2">h</span>omless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e wind generated by t<span class="variation2">h</span>e fall, w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> is infinite. I say t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library is unending. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e idealists argue t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>exagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ey reason t<span class="variation2">h</span>at a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (T<span class="variation2">h</span>e mystics claim t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir ecstasy reveals to t<span class="variation2">h</span>em a circular c<span class="variation2">h</span>amber containing a great circular book, w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose spine is continuous and w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> follows t<span class="variation2">h</span>e complete circle of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e walls; but t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir testimony is suspect; t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir words, obscure. T<span class="variation2">h</span>is cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat t<span class="variation2">h</span>e classic dictum: T<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library is a sp<span class="variation2">h</span>ere w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose exact center is any one of its <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons and w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose circumference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      T<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are five s<span class="variation2">h</span>elves for eac<span class="variation2">h</span> of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon's walls; eac<span class="variation2">h</span> s<span class="variation2">h</span>elf contains t<span class="variation2">h</span>irty-five books of uniform format; eac<span class="variation2">h</span> book is of four <span class="variation2">h</span>undred and ten pages; eac<span class="variation2">h</span> page, of forty lines, eac<span class="variation2">h</span> line, of some eig<span class="variation2">h</span>ty letters w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> are black in color. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are also letters on t<span class="variation2">h</span>e spine of eac<span class="variation2">h</span> book; t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese letters do not indicate or prefigure w<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e pages will say. I know t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>is inco<span class="variation2">h</span>erence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing t<span class="variation2">h</span>e solution (w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is per<span class="variation2">h</span>aps t<span class="variation2">h</span>e capital fact in <span class="variation2">h</span>istory) I wis<span class="variation2">h</span> to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: T<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library exists ab aeterno. T<span class="variation2">h</span>is trut<span class="variation2">h</span>, w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose immediate corollary is t<span class="variation2">h</span>e future eternity of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e imperfect librarian, may be t<span class="variation2">h</span>e product of c<span class="variation2">h</span>ance or of malevolent demiurgi; t<span class="variation2">h</span>e universe, wit<span class="variation2">h</span> its elegant endowment of s<span class="variation2">h</span>elves, of enigmatical volumes, of inex<span class="variation2">h</span>austible stairways for t<span class="variation2">h</span>e traveler and latrines for t<span class="variation2">h</span>e seated librarian, can only be t<span class="variation2">h</span>e work of a god. To perceive t<span class="variation2">h</span>e distance between t<span class="variation2">h</span>e divine and t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>uman, it is enoug<span class="variation2">h</span> to compare t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese crude wavering symbols w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> my fallible <span class="variation2">h</span>and scrawls on t<span class="variation2">h</span>e cover of a book, wit<span class="variation2">h</span> t<span class="variation2">h</span>e organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: T<span class="variation2">h</span>e ort<span class="variation2">h</span>ograp<span class="variation2">h</span>ical symbols are twenty-five in number. ^ T<span class="variation2">h</span>is finding made it possible, t<span class="variation2">h</span>ree <span class="variation2">h</span>undred years ago, to formulate a general t<span class="variation2">h</span>eory of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library and solve satisfactorily t<span class="variation2">h</span>e problem w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> no conjecture <span class="variation2">h</span>ad decip<span class="variation2">h</span>ered: t<span class="variation2">h</span>e formless and c<span class="variation2">h</span>aotic nature of almost all t<span class="variation2">h</span>e books. One w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> my fat<span class="variation2">h</span>er saw in a <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e letters MCV, perversely repeated from t<span class="variation2">h</span>e first line to t<span class="variation2">h</span>e last. Anot<span class="variation2">h</span>er (very muc<span class="variation2">h</span> consulted in t<span class="variation2">h</span>is area) is a mere labyrint<span class="variation2">h</span> of letters, but t<span class="variation2">h</span>e next-to-last page says O<span class="variation2">h</span> time t<span class="variation2">h</span>y pyramids. T<span class="variation2">h</span>is muc<span class="variation2">h</span> is already known: for every sensible line of straig<span class="variation2">h</span>tforward statement, t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are leagues of senseless cacop<span class="variation2">h</span>onies, verbal jumbles and inco<span class="variation2">h</span>erences. (I know of an uncout<span class="variation2">h</span> region w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose librarians repudiate t<span class="variation2">h</span>e vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it wit<span class="variation2">h</span> t<span class="variation2">h</span>at of finding a meaning in dreams or in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e c<span class="variation2">h</span>aotic lines of one's palm... T<span class="variation2">h</span>ey admit t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e inventors of t<span class="variation2">h</span>is writing imitated t<span class="variation2">h</span>e twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>is application is accidental and t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e books signify not<span class="variation2">h</span>ing in t<span class="variation2">h</span>emselves. T<span class="variation2">h</span>is dictum, we s<span class="variation2">h</span>all see, is not entirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it was believed t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e most ancient men, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e first librarians, used a language quite different from t<span class="variation2">h</span>e one we now speak; it is true t<span class="variation2">h</span>at a few miles to t<span class="variation2">h</span>e rig<span class="variation2">h</span>t t<span class="variation2">h</span>e tongue is dialectical and t<span class="variation2">h</span>at ninety floors fart<span class="variation2">h</span>er up, it is incompre<span class="variation2">h</span>ensible. All t<span class="variation2">h</span>is, I repeat, is true, but four <span class="variation2">h</span>undred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter <span class="variation2">h</span>ow dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated t<span class="variation2">h</span>at eac<span class="variation2">h</span> letter could influence t<span class="variation2">h</span>e following one and t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e value of MCV in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e t<span class="variation2">h</span>ird line of page 7 (1) was not t<span class="variation2">h</span>e one t<span class="variation2">h</span>e same series may <span class="variation2">h</span>ave in anot<span class="variation2">h</span>er position on anot<span class="variation2">h</span>er page, but t<span class="variation2">h</span>is vague t<span class="variation2">h</span>esis did not prevail. Ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers t<span class="variation2">h</span>oug<span class="variation2">h</span>t of cryptograp<span class="variation2">h</span>s; generally, t<span class="variation2">h</span>is conjecture <span class="variation2">h</span>as been accepted, t<span class="variation2">h</span>oug<span class="variation2">h</span> not in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e sense in w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> it was formulated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five <span class="variation2">h</span>undred years ago, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e c<span class="variation2">h</span>ief of an upper <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon (2) came upon a book as confusing as t<span class="variation2">h</span>e ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers, but w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> <span class="variation2">h</span>ad nearly two pages of <span class="variation2">h</span>omogeneous lines. <span class="variation2">H</span>e s<span class="variation2">h</span>owed <span class="variation2">h</span>is find to a wandering decoder w<span class="variation2">h</span>o told <span class="variation2">h</span>im t<span class="variation2">h</span>e lines were written in Portuguese; ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers said t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey were Yiddis<span class="variation2">h</span>. Wit<span class="variation2">h</span>in a century, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e language was establis<span class="variation2">h</span>ed: a Samoyedic Lit<span class="variation2">h</span>uanian dialect of Guarani, wit<span class="variation2">h</span> classical Arabian inflections. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e content was also decip<span class="variation2">h</span>ered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated wit<span class="variation2">h</span> examples of variations wit<span class="variation2">h</span> unlimited repetition. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ese examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover t<span class="variation2">h</span>e fundamental law of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library. T<span class="variation2">h</span>is t<span class="variation2">h</span>inker observed t<span class="variation2">h</span>at all t<span class="variation2">h</span>e books, no matter <span class="variation2">h</span>ow diverse t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey mig<span class="variation2">h</span>t be, are made up of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e same elements: t<span class="variation2">h</span>e space, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e period, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e comma, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e twenty-two letters of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e alp<span class="variation2">h</span>abet. <span class="variation2">H</span>e also alleged a fact w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> travelers <span class="variation2">h</span>ave confirmed: In t<span class="variation2">h</span>e vast Library t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are no two identical books. From t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese two incontrovertible premises <span class="variation2">h</span>e deduced t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library is total and t<span class="variation2">h</span>at its s<span class="variation2">h</span>elves register all t<span class="variation2">h</span>e possible combinations of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e twenty-odd ort<span class="variation2">h</span>ograp<span class="variation2">h</span>ical symbols (a number w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span>, t<span class="variation2">h</span>oug<span class="variation2">h</span> extremely vast, is not infinite): Everyt<span class="variation2">h</span>ing: t<span class="variation2">h</span>e minutely detailed <span class="variation2">h</span>istory of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e future, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e arc<span class="variation2">h</span>angels' autobiograp<span class="variation2">h</span>ies, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e fait<span class="variation2">h</span>ful catalogues of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library, t<span class="variation2">h</span>ousands and t<span class="variation2">h</span>ousands of false catalogues, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e demonstration of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e fallacy of t<span class="variation2">h</span>ose catalogues, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e demonstration of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e fallacy of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e true catalogue, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Gnostic gospel of Basilides, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e commentary on t<span class="variation2">h</span>at gospel, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e commentary on t<span class="variation2">h</span>e commentary on t<span class="variation2">h</span>at gospel, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e true story of your deat<span class="variation2">h</span>, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e translation of every book in all languages, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e interpolations of every book in all books.
      <br><br>
      W<span class="variation2">h</span>en it was proclaimed t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library contained all books, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e first impression was one of extravagant <span class="variation2">h</span>appiness. All men felt t<span class="variation2">h</span>emselves to be t<span class="variation2">h</span>e masters of an intact and secret treasure. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ere was no personal or world problem w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose eloquent solution did not exist in some <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e universe was justified, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e universe suddenly usurped t<span class="variation2">h</span>e unlimited dimensions of <span class="variation2">h</span>ope. At t<span class="variation2">h</span>at time a great deal was said about t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Vindications: books of apology and prop<span class="variation2">h</span>ecy w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> vindicated for all time t<span class="variation2">h</span>e acts of every man in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e universe and retained prodigious arcana for <span class="variation2">h</span>is future. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ousands of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e greedy abandoned t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir sweet native <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons and rus<span class="variation2">h</span>ed up t<span class="variation2">h</span>e stairways, urged on by t<span class="variation2">h</span>e vain intention of finding t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir Vindication. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ese pilgrims disputed in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled eac<span class="variation2">h</span> ot<span class="variation2">h</span>er on t<span class="variation2">h</span>e divine stairways, flung t<span class="variation2">h</span>e deceptive books into t<span class="variation2">h</span>e air s<span class="variation2">h</span>afts, met t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir deat<span class="variation2">h</span> cast down in a similar fas<span class="variation2">h</span>ion by t<span class="variation2">h</span>e in<span class="variation2">h</span>abitants of remote regions. Ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers went mad... T<span class="variation2">h</span>e Vindications exist (I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave seen two w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> refer to persons of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e future, to persons w<span class="variation2">h</span>o are per<span class="variation2">h</span>aps not imaginary) but t<span class="variation2">h</span>e searc<span class="variation2">h</span>ers did not remember t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e possibility of a man's finding <span class="variation2">h</span>is Vindication, or some treac<span class="variation2">h</span>erous variation t<span class="variation2">h</span>ereof, can be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At t<span class="variation2">h</span>at time it was also <span class="variation2">h</span>oped t<span class="variation2">h</span>at a clarification of <span class="variation2">h</span>umanity's basic mysteries - t<span class="variation2">h</span>e origin of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library and of time - mig<span class="variation2">h</span>t be found. It is verisimilar t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese grave mysteries could be explained in words: if t<span class="variation2">h</span>e language of p<span class="variation2">h</span>ilosop<span class="variation2">h</span>ers is not sufficient, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e multiform Library will <span class="variation2">h</span>ave produced t<span class="variation2">h</span>e unprecedented language required, wit<span class="variation2">h</span> its vocabularies and grammars. For four centuries now men <span class="variation2">h</span>ave ex<span class="variation2">h</span>austed t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons... T<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are official searc<span class="variation2">h</span>ers, inquisitors. I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave seen t<span class="variation2">h</span>em in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e performance of t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir function: t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey always arrive extremely tired from t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir journeys; t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey speak of a broken stairway w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> almost killed t<span class="variation2">h</span>em; t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey talk wit<span class="variation2">h</span> t<span class="variation2">h</span>e librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey pick up t<span class="variation2">h</span>e nearest volume and leaf t<span class="variation2">h</span>roug<span class="variation2">h</span> it, looking for infamous words. Obviously, no one expects to discover anyt<span class="variation2">h</span>ing.

      As was natural, t<span class="variation2">h</span>is inordinate <span class="variation2">h</span>ope was followed by an excessive depression. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e certitude t<span class="variation2">h</span>at some s<span class="variation2">h</span>elf in some <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon <span class="variation2">h</span>eld precious books and t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasp<span class="variation2">h</span>emous sect suggested t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e searc<span class="variation2">h</span>es s<span class="variation2">h</span>ould cease and t<span class="variation2">h</span>at all men s<span class="variation2">h</span>ould juggle letters and symbols until t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey constructed, by an improbable gift of c<span class="variation2">h</span>ance, t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese canonical books. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e aut<span class="variation2">h</span>orities were obliged to issue severe orders. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e sect disappeared, but in my c<span class="variation2">h</span>ild<span class="variation2">h</span>ood I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave seen old men w<span class="variation2">h</span>o, for long periods of time, would <span class="variation2">h</span>ide in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e latrines wit<span class="variation2">h</span> some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic t<span class="variation2">h</span>e divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers, inversely, believed t<span class="variation2">h</span>at it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ey invaded t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons, s<span class="variation2">h</span>owed credentials w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> were not always false, leafed t<span class="variation2">h</span>roug<span class="variation2">h</span> a volume wit<span class="variation2">h</span> displeasure and condemned w<span class="variation2">h</span>ole s<span class="variation2">h</span>elves: t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir <span class="variation2">h</span>ygienic, ascetic furor caused t<span class="variation2">h</span>e senseless perdition of millions of books. T<span class="variation2">h</span>eir name is execrated, but t<span class="variation2">h</span>ose w<span class="variation2">h</span>o deplore t<span class="variation2">h</span>e "treasures" destroyed by t<span class="variation2">h</span>is frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library is so enormous t<span class="variation2">h</span>at any reduction of <span class="variation2">h</span>uman origin is infinitesimal. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e ot<span class="variation2">h</span>er: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library is total) t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are always several <span class="variation2">h</span>undred t<span class="variation2">h</span>ousand imperfect facsimiles: works w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e consequences of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Purifiers' depredations <span class="variation2">h</span>ave been exaggerated by t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>orror t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese fanatics produced. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ey were urged on by t<span class="variation2">h</span>e delirium of trying to reac<span class="variation2">h</span> t<span class="variation2">h</span>e books in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Crimson <span class="variation2">H</span>exagon: books w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose format is smaller t<span class="variation2">h</span>an usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of anot<span class="variation2">h</span>er superstition of t<span class="variation2">h</span>at time: t<span class="variation2">h</span>at of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Man of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Book. On some s<span class="variation2">h</span>elf in some <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon (men reasoned) t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere must exist a book w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> is t<span class="variation2">h</span>e formula and perfect compendium of all t<span class="variation2">h</span>e rest: some librarian <span class="variation2">h</span>as gone t<span class="variation2">h</span>roug<span class="variation2">h</span> it and <span class="variation2">h</span>e is analogous to a god. In t<span class="variation2">h</span>e language of t<span class="variation2">h</span>is zone vestiges of t<span class="variation2">h</span>is remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in searc<span class="variation2">h</span> of <span class="variation2">H</span>im. For a century t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey <span class="variation2">h</span>ave ex<span class="variation2">h</span>austed in vain t<span class="variation2">h</span>e most varied areas. <span class="variation2">H</span>ow could one locate t<span class="variation2">h</span>e venerated and secret <span class="variation2">h</span>exagon w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> <span class="variation2">h</span>oused <span class="variation2">H</span>im? Someone proposed a regressive met<span class="variation2">h</span>od: To locate book A, consult first book B w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventures suc<span class="variation2">h</span> as t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese, I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere is a total book on some s<span class="variation2">h</span>elf of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e universe (3) ; I pray to t<span class="variation2">h</span>e unknown gods t<span class="variation2">h</span>at a man - just one, even t<span class="variation2">h</span>oug<span class="variation2">h</span> it were t<span class="variation2">h</span>ousands of years ago! - may <span class="variation2">h</span>ave examined and read it. If <span class="variation2">h</span>onor and wisdom and <span class="variation2">h</span>appiness are not for me, let t<span class="variation2">h</span>em be for ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers. Let <span class="variation2">h</span>eaven exist, t<span class="variation2">h</span>oug<span class="variation2">h</span> my place be in <span class="variation2">h</span>ell. Let me be outraged and anni<span class="variation2">h</span>ilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e impious maintain t<span class="variation2">h</span>at nonsense is normal in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library and t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e reasonable (and even <span class="variation2">h</span>umble and pure co<span class="variation2">h</span>erence) is an almost miraculous exception. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ey speak (I know) of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e "feveris<span class="variation2">h</span> Library w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose c<span class="variation2">h</span>ance volumes are constantly in danger of c<span class="variation2">h</span>anging into ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers and affirm, negate and confuse everyt<span class="variation2">h</span>ing like a delirious divinity." T<span class="variation2">h</span>ese words, w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> not only denounce t<span class="variation2">h</span>e disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir aut<span class="variation2">h</span>ors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In trut<span class="variation2">h</span>, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by t<span class="variation2">h</span>e twenty-five ort<span class="variation2">h</span>ograp<span class="variation2">h</span>ical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e best volume of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e many <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons under my administration is entitled T<span class="variation2">h</span>e Combed T<span class="variation2">h</span>underclap and anot<span class="variation2">h</span>er T<span class="variation2">h</span>e Plaster Cramp and anot<span class="variation2">h</span>er Axaxaxas mlo. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ese p<span class="variation2">h</span>rases, at first glance inco<span class="variation2">h</span>erent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptograp<span class="variation2">h</span>ical or allegorical manner; suc<span class="variation2">h</span> a justification is verbal and, ex <span class="variation2">h</span>ypot<span class="variation2">h</span>esi, already figures in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library.

      w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> t<span class="variation2">h</span>e divine Library <span class="variation2">h</span>as not foreseen and w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> is not filled wit<span class="variation2">h</span> tenderness and fear, w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> is not, in one of t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese languages, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. T<span class="variation2">h</span>is wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e t<span class="variation2">h</span>irty volumes of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e five s<span class="variation2">h</span>elves of one of t<span class="variation2">h</span>e innumerable <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of possible languages use t<span class="variation2">h</span>e same vocabulary; in some of t<span class="variation2">h</span>em, t<span class="variation2">h</span>e symbol library allows t<span class="variation2">h</span>e correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of <span class="variation2">h</span>exagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anyt<span class="variation2">h</span>ing else, and t<span class="variation2">h</span>ese seven words w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> define it <span class="variation2">h</span>ave anot<span class="variation2">h</span>er value. You w<span class="variation2">h</span>o read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)
      <br><br>
      T<span class="variation2">h</span>e met<span class="variation2">h</span>odical task of writing distracts me from t<span class="variation2">h</span>e present state of men. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e certitude t<span class="variation2">h</span>at everyt<span class="variation2">h</span>ing <span class="variation2">h</span>as been written negates us or turns us into p<span class="variation2">h</span>antoms. I know of districts in w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> t<span class="variation2">h</span>e young men prostrate t<span class="variation2">h</span>emselves before books and kiss t<span class="variation2">h</span>eir pages in a barbarous manner, but t<span class="variation2">h</span>ey do not know <span class="variation2">h</span>ow to decip<span class="variation2">h</span>er a single letter. Epidemics, <span class="variation2">h</span>eretical conflicts, peregrinations w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> inevitably degenerate into banditry, <span class="variation2">h</span>ave decimated t<span class="variation2">h</span>e population. I believe I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave mentioned suicides, more and more frequent wit<span class="variation2">h</span> t<span class="variation2">h</span>e years. Per<span class="variation2">h</span>aps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>uman species - t<span class="variation2">h</span>e unique species - is about to be extinguis<span class="variation2">h</span>ed, but t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped wit<span class="variation2">h</span> precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave just written t<span class="variation2">h</span>e word "infinite".' I <span class="variation2">h</span>ave not interpolated t<span class="variation2">h</span>is adjective out of r<span class="variation2">h</span>etorical <span class="variation2">h</span>abit; I say t<span class="variation2">h</span>at it is not illogical to t<span class="variation2">h</span>ink t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e world is infinite. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ose w<span class="variation2">h</span>o judge it to be limited postulate t<span class="variation2">h</span>at in remote places t<span class="variation2">h</span>e corridors and stairways and <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons can conceivably come to an end - w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> is absurd. T<span class="variation2">h</span>ose w<span class="variation2">h</span>o imagine it to be wit<span class="variation2">h</span>out limit forget t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e possible number of books does <span class="variation2">h</span>ave suc<span class="variation2">h</span> a limit. I venture to suggest t<span class="variation2">h</span>is solution to t<span class="variation2">h</span>e ancient problem: T<span class="variation2">h</span>e Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries <span class="variation2">h</span>e would see t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>e same volumes were repeated in t<span class="variation2">h</span>e same disorder (w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span>, t<span class="variation2">h</span>us repeated, would be an order: t<span class="variation2">h</span>e Order). My solitude is gladdened by t<span class="variation2">h</span>is elegant <span class="variation2">h</span>ope (4).

      1. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. T<span class="variation2">h</span>e punctuation <span class="variation2">h</span>as been limited to t<span class="variation2">h</span>e comma and t<span class="variation2">h</span>e period.

      2. Before, t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere was a man for every t<span class="variation2">h</span>ree <span class="variation2">h</span>exagons.

      3. I repeat: it suffices t<span class="variation2">h</span>at a book be possible for it to exist. Only t<span class="variation2">h</span>e impossible is excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, alt<span class="variation2">h</span>oug<span class="variation2">h</span> no doubt t<span class="variation2">h</span>ere are books w<span class="variation2">h</span>ic<span class="variation2">h</span> discuss and negate and demonstrate t<span class="variation2">h</span>is possibility and ot<span class="variation2">h</span>ers w<span class="variation2">h</span>ose structure corresponds to t<span class="variation2">h</span>at of a ladder.

      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo <span class="variation2">h</span>as observed t<span class="variation2">h</span>at t<span class="variation2">h</span>is vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinitely t<span class="variation2">h</span>in leaves. (In t<span class="variation2">h</span>e early seventeent<span class="variation2">h</span> century, Cavalieri said t<span class="variation2">h</span>at all solid bodies are t<span class="variation2">h</span>e superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) T<span class="variation2">h</span>e <span class="variation2">h</span>andling of t<span class="variation2">h</span>is silky vade mecum would not be convenient: eac<span class="variation2">h</span> apparent page would unfold into ot<span class="variation2">h</span>er analogous ones; t<span class="variation2">h</span>e inconceivable middle page would <span class="variation2">h</span>ave no reverse.
