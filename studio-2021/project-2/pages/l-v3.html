      The Anatomy of Me<span class="variation3">l</span>ancho<span class="variation3">l</span>y, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which others ca<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagona<span class="variation3">l</span> ga<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>eries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very <span class="variation3">l</span>ow rai<span class="variation3">l</span>ings. From any of the hexagons one can see, interminab<span class="variation3">l</span>y, the upper and <span class="variation3">l</span>ower f<span class="variation3">l</span>oors. The distribution of the ga<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>eries is invariab<span class="variation3">l</span>e. Twenty she<span class="variation3">l</span>ves, five <span class="variation3">l</span>ong she<span class="variation3">l</span>ves per side, cover a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from f<span class="variation3">l</span>oor to cei<span class="variation3">l</span>ing, scarce<span class="variation3">l</span>y exceeds that of a norma<span class="variation3">l</span> bookcase. One of the free sides <span class="variation3">l</span>eads to a narrow ha<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>way which opens onto another ga<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ery, identica<span class="variation3">l</span> to the first and to a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> the rest. To the <span class="variation3">l</span>eft and right of the ha<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>way there are two very sma<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> c<span class="variation3">l</span>osets. In the first, one may s<span class="variation3">l</span>eep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's feca<span class="variation3">l</span> necessities. A<span class="variation3">l</span>so through here passes a spira<span class="variation3">l</span> stairway, which sinks abysma<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>y and soars upwards to remote distances. In the ha<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>way there is a mirror which faithfu<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>y dup<span class="variation3">l</span>icates a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> appearances. Men usua<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>y infer from this mirror that the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary is not infinite (if it were, why this i<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>usory dup<span class="variation3">l</span>ication?); I prefer to dream that its po<span class="variation3">l</span>ished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... <span class="variation3">L</span>ight is provided by some spherica<span class="variation3">l</span> fruit which bear the name of <span class="variation3">l</span>amps. There are two, transversa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>y p<span class="variation3">l</span>aced, in each hexagon. The <span class="variation3">l</span>ight they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation3">L</span>ike a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> men of the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary, I have trave<span class="variation3">l</span>ed in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the cata<span class="variation3">l</span>ogue of cata<span class="variation3">l</span>ogues; now that my eyes can hard<span class="variation3">l</span>y decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few <span class="variation3">l</span>eagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there wi<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> be no <span class="variation3">l</span>ack of pious hands to throw me over the rai<span class="variation3">l</span>ing; my grave wi<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> be the fathom<span class="variation3">l</span>ess air; my body wi<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> sink end<span class="variation3">l</span>ess<span class="variation3">l</span>y and decay and disso<span class="variation3">l</span>ve in the wind generated by the fa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>, which is infinite. I say that the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary is unending. The idea<span class="variation3">l</span>ists argue that the hexagona<span class="variation3">l</span> rooms are a necessary form of abso<span class="variation3">l</span>ute space or, at <span class="variation3">l</span>east, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangu<span class="variation3">l</span>ar or pentagona<span class="variation3">l</span> room is inconceivab<span class="variation3">l</span>e. (The mystics c<span class="variation3">l</span>aim that their ecstasy revea<span class="variation3">l</span>s to them a circu<span class="variation3">l</span>ar chamber containing a great circu<span class="variation3">l</span>ar book, whose spine is continuous and which fo<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ows the comp<span class="variation3">l</span>ete circ<span class="variation3">l</span>e of the wa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>s; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyc<span class="variation3">l</span>ica<span class="variation3">l</span> book is God.) <span class="variation3">L</span>et it suffice now for me to repeat the c<span class="variation3">l</span>assic dictum: The <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessib<span class="variation3">l</span>e.
      <br><br>
      There are five she<span class="variation3">l</span>ves for each of the hexagon's wa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>s; each she<span class="variation3">l</span>f contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty <span class="variation3">l</span>ines, each <span class="variation3">l</span>ine, of some eighty <span class="variation3">l</span>etters which are b<span class="variation3">l</span>ack in co<span class="variation3">l</span>or. There are a<span class="variation3">l</span>so <span class="variation3">l</span>etters on the spine of each book; these <span class="variation3">l</span>etters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages wi<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the so<span class="variation3">l</span>ution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capita<span class="variation3">l</span> fact in history) I wish to reca<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate coro<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ary is the future eternity of the wor<span class="variation3">l</span>d, cannot be p<span class="variation3">l</span>aced in doubt by any reasonab<span class="variation3">l</span>e mind. Man, the imperfect <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrarian, may be the product of chance or of ma<span class="variation3">l</span>evo<span class="variation3">l</span>ent demiurgi; the universe, with its e<span class="variation3">l</span>egant endowment of she<span class="variation3">l</span>ves, of enigmatica<span class="variation3">l</span> vo<span class="variation3">l</span>umes, of inexhaustib<span class="variation3">l</span>e stairways for the trave<span class="variation3">l</span>er and <span class="variation3">l</span>atrines for the seated <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrarian, can on<span class="variation3">l</span>y be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbo<span class="variation3">l</span>s which my fa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ib<span class="variation3">l</span>e hand scraw<span class="variation3">l</span>s on the cover of a book, with the organic <span class="variation3">l</span>etters inside: punctua<span class="variation3">l</span>, de<span class="variation3">l</span>icate, perfect<span class="variation3">l</span>y b<span class="variation3">l</span>ack, inimitab<span class="variation3">l</span>y symmetrica<span class="variation3">l</span>.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthographica<span class="variation3">l</span> symbo<span class="variation3">l</span>s are twenty-five in number. ^ This finding made it possib<span class="variation3">l</span>e, three hundred years ago, to formu<span class="variation3">l</span>ate a genera<span class="variation3">l</span> theory of the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary and so<span class="variation3">l</span>ve satisfactori<span class="variation3">l</span>y the prob<span class="variation3">l</span>em which no conjecture had deciphered: the form<span class="variation3">l</span>ess and chaotic nature of a<span class="variation3">l</span>most a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> the books. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the <span class="variation3">l</span>etters MCV, perverse<span class="variation3">l</span>y repeated from the first <span class="variation3">l</span>ine to the <span class="variation3">l</span>ast. Another (very much consu<span class="variation3">l</span>ted in this area) is a mere <span class="variation3">l</span>abyrinth of <span class="variation3">l</span>etters, but the next-to-<span class="variation3">l</span>ast page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is a<span class="variation3">l</span>ready known: for every sensib<span class="variation3">l</span>e <span class="variation3">l</span>ine of straightforward statement, there are <span class="variation3">l</span>eagues of sense<span class="variation3">l</span>ess cacophonies, verba<span class="variation3">l</span> jumb<span class="variation3">l</span>es and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic <span class="variation3">l</span>ines of one's pa<span class="variation3">l</span>m... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natura<span class="variation3">l</span> symbo<span class="variation3">l</span>s, but maintain that this app<span class="variation3">l</span>ication is accidenta<span class="variation3">l</span> and that the books signify nothing in themse<span class="variation3">l</span>ves. This dictum, we sha<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> see, is not entire<span class="variation3">l</span>y fa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>acious.)
      <br><br>
      For a <span class="variation3">l</span>ong time it was be<span class="variation3">l</span>ieved that these impenetrab<span class="variation3">l</span>e books corresponded to past or remote <span class="variation3">l</span>anguages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrarians, used a <span class="variation3">l</span>anguage quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few mi<span class="variation3">l</span>es to the right the tongue is dia<span class="variation3">l</span>ectica<span class="variation3">l</span> and that ninety f<span class="variation3">l</span>oors farther up, it is incomprehensib<span class="variation3">l</span>e. A<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of ina<span class="variation3">l</span>terab<span class="variation3">l</span>e MCV's cannot correspond to any <span class="variation3">l</span>anguage, no matter how dia<span class="variation3">l</span>ectica<span class="variation3">l</span> or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each <span class="variation3">l</span>etter cou<span class="variation3">l</span>d inf<span class="variation3">l</span>uence the fo<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>owing one and that the va<span class="variation3">l</span>ue of MCV in the third <span class="variation3">l</span>ine of page 7 (1) was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevai<span class="variation3">l</span>. Others thought of cryptographs; genera<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>y, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formu<span class="variation3">l</span>ated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon (2) came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had near<span class="variation3">l</span>y two pages of homogeneous <span class="variation3">l</span>ines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who to<span class="variation3">l</span>d him the <span class="variation3">l</span>ines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the <span class="variation3">l</span>anguage was estab<span class="variation3">l</span>ished: a Samoyedic <span class="variation3">L</span>ithuanian dia<span class="variation3">l</span>ect of Guarani, with c<span class="variation3">l</span>assica<span class="variation3">l</span> Arabian inf<span class="variation3">l</span>ections. The content was a<span class="variation3">l</span>so deciphered: some notions of combinative ana<span class="variation3">l</span>ysis, i<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ustrated with examp<span class="variation3">l</span>es of variations with un<span class="variation3">l</span>imited repetition. These examp<span class="variation3">l</span>es made it possib<span class="variation3">l</span>e for a <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrarian of genius to discover the fundamenta<span class="variation3">l</span> <span class="variation3">l</span>aw of the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary. This thinker observed that a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same e<span class="variation3">l</span>ements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two <span class="variation3">l</span>etters of the a<span class="variation3">l</span>phabet. He a<span class="variation3">l</span>so a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>eged a fact which trave<span class="variation3">l</span>ers have confirmed: In the vast <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary there are no two identica<span class="variation3">l</span> books. From these two incontrovertib<span class="variation3">l</span>e premises he deduced that the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary is tota<span class="variation3">l</span> and that its she<span class="variation3">l</span>ves register a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> the possib<span class="variation3">l</span>e combinations of the twenty-odd orthographica<span class="variation3">l</span> symbo<span class="variation3">l</span>s (a number which, though extreme<span class="variation3">l</span>y vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minute<span class="variation3">l</span>y detai<span class="variation3">l</span>ed history of the future, the archange<span class="variation3">l</span>s' autobiographies, the faithfu<span class="variation3">l</span> cata<span class="variation3">l</span>ogues of the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary, thousands and thousands of fa<span class="variation3">l</span>se cata<span class="variation3">l</span>ogues, the demonstration of the fa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>acy of those cata<span class="variation3">l</span>ogues, the demonstration of the fa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>acy of the true cata<span class="variation3">l</span>ogue, the Gnostic gospe<span class="variation3">l</span> of Basi<span class="variation3">l</span>ides, the commentary on that gospe<span class="variation3">l</span>, the commentary on the commentary on that gospe<span class="variation3">l</span>, the true story of your death, the trans<span class="variation3">l</span>ation of every book in a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> <span class="variation3">l</span>anguages, the interpo<span class="variation3">l</span>ations of every book in a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> books.
      <br><br>
      When it was proc<span class="variation3">l</span>aimed that the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary contained a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. A<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> men fe<span class="variation3">l</span>t themse<span class="variation3">l</span>ves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no persona<span class="variation3">l</span> or wor<span class="variation3">l</span>d prob<span class="variation3">l</span>em whose e<span class="variation3">l</span>oquent so<span class="variation3">l</span>ution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe sudden<span class="variation3">l</span>y usurped the un<span class="variation3">l</span>imited dimensions of hope. At that time a great dea<span class="variation3">l</span> was said about the Vindications: books of apo<span class="variation3">l</span>ogy and prophecy which vindicated for a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pi<span class="variation3">l</span>grims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strang<span class="variation3">l</span>ed each other on the divine stairways, f<span class="variation3">l</span>ung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a simi<span class="variation3">l</span>ar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibi<span class="variation3">l</span>ity of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was a<span class="variation3">l</span>so hoped that a c<span class="variation3">l</span>arification of humanity's basic mysteries - the origin of the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary and of time - might be found. It is verisimi<span class="variation3">l</span>ar that these grave mysteries cou<span class="variation3">l</span>d be exp<span class="variation3">l</span>ained in words: if the <span class="variation3">l</span>anguage of phi<span class="variation3">l</span>osophers is not sufficient, the mu<span class="variation3">l</span>tiform <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary wi<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> have produced the unprecedented <span class="variation3">l</span>anguage required, with its vocabu<span class="variation3">l</span>aries and grammars. For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are officia<span class="variation3">l</span> searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they a<span class="variation3">l</span>ways arrive extreme<span class="variation3">l</span>y tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which a<span class="variation3">l</span>most ki<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ed them; they ta<span class="variation3">l</span>k with the <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrarian of ga<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>eries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest vo<span class="variation3">l</span>ume and <span class="variation3">l</span>eaf through it, <span class="variation3">l</span>ooking for infamous words. Obvious<span class="variation3">l</span>y, no one expects to discover anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natura<span class="variation3">l</span>, this inordinate hope was fo<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>owed by an excessive depression. The certitude that some she<span class="variation3">l</span>f in some hexagon he<span class="variation3">l</span>d precious books and that these precious books were inaccessib<span class="variation3">l</span>e, seemed a<span class="variation3">l</span>most into<span class="variation3">l</span>erab<span class="variation3">l</span>e. A b<span class="variation3">l</span>asphemous sect suggested that the searches shou<span class="variation3">l</span>d cease and that a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> men shou<span class="variation3">l</span>d jugg<span class="variation3">l</span>e <span class="variation3">l</span>etters and symbo<span class="variation3">l</span>s unti<span class="variation3">l</span> they constructed, by an improbab<span class="variation3">l</span>e gift of chance, these canonica<span class="variation3">l</span> books. The authorities were ob<span class="variation3">l</span>iged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my chi<span class="variation3">l</span>dhood I have seen o<span class="variation3">l</span>d men who, for <span class="variation3">l</span>ong periods of time, wou<span class="variation3">l</span>d hide in the <span class="variation3">l</span>atrines with some meta<span class="variation3">l</span> disks in a forbidden dice cup and feeb<span class="variation3">l</span>y mimic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inverse<span class="variation3">l</span>y, be<span class="variation3">l</span>ieved that it was fundamenta<span class="variation3">l</span> to e<span class="variation3">l</span>iminate use<span class="variation3">l</span>ess works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentia<span class="variation3">l</span>s which were not a<span class="variation3">l</span>ways fa<span class="variation3">l</span>se, <span class="variation3">l</span>eafed through a vo<span class="variation3">l</span>ume with disp<span class="variation3">l</span>easure and condemned who<span class="variation3">l</span>e she<span class="variation3">l</span>ves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the sense<span class="variation3">l</span>ess perdition of mi<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who dep<span class="variation3">l</span>ore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neg<span class="variation3">l</span>ect two notab<span class="variation3">l</span>e facts. One: the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesima<span class="variation3">l</span>. The other: every copy is unique, irrep<span class="variation3">l</span>aceab<span class="variation3">l</span>e, but (since the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary is tota<span class="variation3">l</span>) there are a<span class="variation3">l</span>ways severa<span class="variation3">l</span> hundred thousand imperfect facsimi<span class="variation3">l</span>es: works which differ on<span class="variation3">l</span>y in a <span class="variation3">l</span>etter or a comma. Counter to genera<span class="variation3">l</span> opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on by the de<span class="variation3">l</span>irium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is sma<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>er than usua<span class="variation3">l</span>, a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>-powerfu<span class="variation3">l</span>, i<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ustrated and magica<span class="variation3">l</span>.
      <br><br>
      We a<span class="variation3">l</span>so know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some she<span class="variation3">l</span>f in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formu<span class="variation3">l</span>a and perfect compendium of a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> the rest: some <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrarian has gone through it and he is ana<span class="variation3">l</span>ogous to a god. In the <span class="variation3">l</span>anguage of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cu<span class="variation3">l</span>t sti<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How cou<span class="variation3">l</span>d one <span class="variation3">l</span>ocate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To <span class="variation3">l</span>ocate book A, consu<span class="variation3">l</span>t first book B which indicates A's position; to <span class="variation3">l</span>ocate book B, consu<span class="variation3">l</span>t first a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem un<span class="variation3">l</span>ike<span class="variation3">l</span>y to me that there is a tota<span class="variation3">l</span> book on some she<span class="variation3">l</span>f of the universe (3) ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, <span class="variation3">l</span>et them be for others. <span class="variation3">L</span>et heaven exist, though my p<span class="variation3">l</span>ace be in he<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>. <span class="variation3">L</span>et me be outraged and annihi<span class="variation3">l</span>ated, but for one instant, in one being, <span class="variation3">l</span>et Your enormous <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is norma<span class="variation3">l</span> in the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary and that the reasonab<span class="variation3">l</span>e (and even humb<span class="variation3">l</span>e and pure coherence) is an a<span class="variation3">l</span>most miracu<span class="variation3">l</span>ous exception. They speak (I know) of the "feverish <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary whose chance vo<span class="variation3">l</span>umes are constant<span class="variation3">l</span>y in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything <span class="variation3">l</span>ike a de<span class="variation3">l</span>irious divinity." These words, which not on<span class="variation3">l</span>y denounce the disorder but exemp<span class="variation3">l</span>ify it as we<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>, notorious<span class="variation3">l</span>y prove their authors' abominab<span class="variation3">l</span>e taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary inc<span class="variation3">l</span>udes a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> verba<span class="variation3">l</span> structures, a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographica<span class="variation3">l</span> symbo<span class="variation3">l</span>s, but not a sing<span class="variation3">l</span>e examp<span class="variation3">l</span>e of abso<span class="variation3">l</span>ute nonsense. It is use<span class="variation3">l</span>ess to observe that the best vo<span class="variation3">l</span>ume of the many hexagons under my administration is entit<span class="variation3">l</span>ed The Combed Thunderc<span class="variation3">l</span>ap and another The P<span class="variation3">l</span>aster Cramp and another Axaxaxas m<span class="variation3">l</span>o. These phrases, at first g<span class="variation3">l</span>ance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographica<span class="variation3">l</span> or a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>egorica<span class="variation3">l</span> manner; such a justification is verba<span class="variation3">l</span> and, ex hypothesi, a<span class="variation3">l</span>ready figures in the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary. I cannot combine some characters

      which the divine <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrib<span class="variation3">l</span>e meaning. No one can articu<span class="variation3">l</span>ate a sy<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ab<span class="variation3">l</span>e which is not fi<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ed with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these <span class="variation3">l</span>anguages, the powerfu<span class="variation3">l</span> name of a god. To speak is to fa<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> into tauto<span class="variation3">l</span>ogy. This wordy and use<span class="variation3">l</span>ess epist<span class="variation3">l</span>e a<span class="variation3">l</span>ready exists in one of the thirty vo<span class="variation3">l</span>umes of the five she<span class="variation3">l</span>ves of one of the innumerab<span class="variation3">l</span>e hexagons - and its refutation as we<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>. (An n number of possib<span class="variation3">l</span>e <span class="variation3">l</span>anguages use the same vocabu<span class="variation3">l</span>ary; in some of them, the symbo<span class="variation3">l</span> <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrary a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ows the correct definition a ubiquitous and <span class="variation3">l</span>asting system of hexagona<span class="variation3">l</span> ga<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>eries, but <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrary is bread or pyramid or anything e<span class="variation3">l</span>se, and these seven words which define it have another va<span class="variation3">l</span>ue. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my <span class="variation3">l</span>anguage?)

      The methodica<span class="variation3">l</span> task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themse<span class="variation3">l</span>ves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a sing<span class="variation3">l</span>e <span class="variation3">l</span>etter. Epidemics, heretica<span class="variation3">l</span> conf<span class="variation3">l</span>icts, peregrinations which inevitab<span class="variation3">l</span>y degenerate into banditry, have decimated the popu<span class="variation3">l</span>ation. I be<span class="variation3">l</span>ieve I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my o<span class="variation3">l</span>d age and fearfu<span class="variation3">l</span>ness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary wi<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> endure: i<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>uminated, so<span class="variation3">l</span>itary, infinite, perfect<span class="variation3">l</span>y motion<span class="variation3">l</span>ess, equipped with precious vo<span class="variation3">l</span>umes, use<span class="variation3">l</span>ess, incorruptib<span class="variation3">l</span>e, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the word "infinite".' I have not interpo<span class="variation3">l</span>ated this adjective out of rhetorica<span class="variation3">l</span> habit; I say that it is not i<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span>ogica<span class="variation3">l</span> to think that the wor<span class="variation3">l</span>d is infinite. Those who judge it to be <span class="variation3">l</span>imited postu<span class="variation3">l</span>ate that in remote p<span class="variation3">l</span>aces the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivab<span class="variation3">l</span>y come to an end - which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without <span class="variation3">l</span>imit forget that the possib<span class="variation3">l</span>e number of books does have such a <span class="variation3">l</span>imit. I venture to suggest this so<span class="variation3">l</span>ution to the ancient prob<span class="variation3">l</span>em: The <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary is un<span class="variation3">l</span>imited and cyc<span class="variation3">l</span>ica<span class="variation3">l</span>. If an eterna<span class="variation3">l</span> trave<span class="variation3">l</span>er were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he wou<span class="variation3">l</span>d see that the same vo<span class="variation3">l</span>umes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, wou<span class="variation3">l</span>d be an order: the Order). My so<span class="variation3">l</span>itude is g<span class="variation3">l</span>addened by this e<span class="variation3">l</span>egant hope (4).

      1. The origina<span class="variation3">l</span> manuscript does not contain digits or capita<span class="variation3">l</span> <span class="variation3">l</span>etters. The punctuation has been <span class="variation3">l</span>imited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two <span class="variation3">l</span>etters of the a<span class="variation3">l</span>phabet are the twenty-five symbo<span class="variation3">l</span>s considered sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's note.)

      2. Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pu<span class="variation3">l</span>monary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakab<span class="variation3">l</span>e me<span class="variation3">l</span>ancho<span class="variation3">l</span>y: at times I have trave<span class="variation3">l</span>ed for many nights through corridors and a<span class="variation3">l</span>ong po<span class="variation3">l</span>ished stairways without finding a sing<span class="variation3">l</span>e <span class="variation3">l</span>ibrarian.
      <br><br>
      3. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possib<span class="variation3">l</span>e for it to exist. On<span class="variation3">l</span>y the impossib<span class="variation3">l</span>e is exc<span class="variation3">l</span>uded. For examp<span class="variation3">l</span>e: no book can be a <span class="variation3">l</span>adder, a<span class="variation3">l</span>though no doubt there are books which discuss and negate and demonstrate this possibi<span class="variation3">l</span>ity and others whose structure corresponds to that of a <span class="variation3">l</span>adder.

      4. <span class="variation3">L</span>etizia A<span class="variation3">l</span>varez de To<span class="variation3">l</span>edo has observed that this vast <span class="variation3">L</span>ibrary is use<span class="variation3">l</span>ess: rigorous<span class="variation3">l</span>y speaking, a sing<span class="variation3">l</span>e vo<span class="variation3">l</span>ume wou<span class="variation3">l</span>d be sufficient, a vo<span class="variation3">l</span>ume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinite<span class="variation3">l</span>y thin <span class="variation3">l</span>eaves. (In the ear<span class="variation3">l</span>y seventeenth century, Cava<span class="variation3">l</span>ieri said that a<span class="variation3">l</span><span class="variation3">l</span> so<span class="variation3">l</span>id bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of p<span class="variation3">l</span>anes.) The hand<span class="variation3">l</span>ing of this si<span class="variation3">l</span>ky vade mecum wou<span class="variation3">l</span>d not be convenient: each apparent page wou<span class="variation3">l</span>d unfo<span class="variation3">l</span>d into other ana<span class="variation3">l</span>ogous ones; the inconceivab<span class="variation3">l</span>e midd<span class="variation3">l</span>e page wou<span class="variation3">l</span>d have no reverse.
