      By thi<span class="variation1">s</span> art you may contemplate the variation<span class="variation1">s</span> of the 23 letter<span class="variation1">s</span>...
      The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, <span class="variation1">s</span>ect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The univer<span class="variation1">s</span>e (which other<span class="variation1">s</span> call the Library) i<span class="variation1">s</span> compo<span class="variation1">s</span>ed of an indefinite and perhap<span class="variation1">s</span> infinite number of hexagonal gallerie<span class="variation1">s</span>, with va<span class="variation1">s</span>t air <span class="variation1">s</span>haft<span class="variation1">s</span> between, <span class="variation1">s</span>urrounded by very low railing<span class="variation1">s</span>. From any of the hexagon<span class="variation1">s</span> one can <span class="variation1">s</span>ee, interminably, the upper and lower floor<span class="variation1">s</span>. The di<span class="variation1">s</span>tribution of the gallerie<span class="variation1">s</span> i<span class="variation1">s</span> invariable. Twenty <span class="variation1">s</span>helve<span class="variation1">s</span>, five long <span class="variation1">s</span>helve<span class="variation1">s</span> per <span class="variation1">s</span>ide, cover all the <span class="variation1">s</span>ide<span class="variation1">s</span> except two; their height, which i<span class="variation1">s</span> the di<span class="variation1">s</span>tance from floor to ceiling, <span class="variation1">s</span>carcely exceed<span class="variation1">s</span> that of a normal bookca<span class="variation1">s</span>e. One of the free <span class="variation1">s</span>ide<span class="variation1">s</span> lead<span class="variation1">s</span> to a narrow hallway which open<span class="variation1">s</span> onto another gallery, identical to the fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t and to all the re<span class="variation1">s</span>t. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very <span class="variation1">s</span>mall clo<span class="variation1">s</span>et<span class="variation1">s</span>. In the fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t, one may <span class="variation1">s</span>leep <span class="variation1">s</span>tanding up; in the other, <span class="variation1">s</span>ati<span class="variation1">s</span>fy one'<span class="variation1">s</span> fecal nece<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>itie<span class="variation1">s</span>. Al<span class="variation1">s</span>o through here pa<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>e<span class="variation1">s</span> a <span class="variation1">s</span>piral <span class="variation1">s</span>tairway, which <span class="variation1">s</span>ink<span class="variation1">s</span> aby<span class="variation1">s</span>mally and <span class="variation1">s</span>oar<span class="variation1">s</span> upward<span class="variation1">s</span> to remote di<span class="variation1">s</span>tance<span class="variation1">s</span>. In the hallway there i<span class="variation1">s</span> a mirror which faithfully duplicate<span class="variation1">s</span> all appearance<span class="variation1">s</span>. Men u<span class="variation1">s</span>ually infer from thi<span class="variation1">s</span> mirror that the Library i<span class="variation1">s</span> not infinite (if it were, why thi<span class="variation1">s</span> illu<span class="variation1">s</span>ory duplication?); I prefer to dream that it<span class="variation1">s</span> poli<span class="variation1">s</span>hed <span class="variation1">s</span>urface<span class="variation1">s</span> repre<span class="variation1">s</span>ent and promi<span class="variation1">s</span>e the infinite... Light i<span class="variation1">s</span> provided by <span class="variation1">s</span>ome <span class="variation1">s</span>pherical fruit which bear the name of lamp<span class="variation1">s</span>. There are two, tran<span class="variation1">s</span>ver<span class="variation1">s</span>ally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit i<span class="variation1">s</span> in<span class="variation1">s</span>ufficient, ince<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in <span class="variation1">s</span>earch of a book, perhap<span class="variation1">s</span> the catalogue of catalogue<span class="variation1">s</span>; now that my eye<span class="variation1">s</span> can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die ju<span class="variation1">s</span>t a few league<span class="variation1">s</span> from the hexagon in which I wa<span class="variation1">s</span> born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of piou<span class="variation1">s</span> hand<span class="variation1">s</span> to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomle<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> air; my body will <span class="variation1">s</span>ink endle<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ly and decay and di<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>olve in the wind generated by the fall, which i<span class="variation1">s</span> infinite. I <span class="variation1">s</span>ay that the Library i<span class="variation1">s</span> unending. The ideali<span class="variation1">s</span>t<span class="variation1">s</span> argue that the hexagonal room<span class="variation1">s</span> are a nece<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ary form of ab<span class="variation1">s</span>olute <span class="variation1">s</span>pace or, at lea<span class="variation1">s</span>t, of our intuition of <span class="variation1">s</span>pace. They rea<span class="variation1">s</span>on that a triangular or pentagonal room i<span class="variation1">s</span> inconceivable. (The my<span class="variation1">s</span>tic<span class="variation1">s</span> claim that their ec<span class="variation1">s</span>ta<span class="variation1">s</span>y reveal<span class="variation1">s</span> to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, who<span class="variation1">s</span>e <span class="variation1">s</span>pine i<span class="variation1">s</span> continuou<span class="variation1">s</span> and which follow<span class="variation1">s</span> the complete circle of the wall<span class="variation1">s</span>; but their te<span class="variation1">s</span>timony i<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>u<span class="variation1">s</span>pect; their word<span class="variation1">s</span>, ob<span class="variation1">s</span>cure. Thi<span class="variation1">s</span> cyclical book i<span class="variation1">s</span> God.) Let it <span class="variation1">s</span>uffice now for me to repeat the cla<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ic dictum: The Library i<span class="variation1">s</span> a <span class="variation1">s</span>phere who<span class="variation1">s</span>e exact center i<span class="variation1">s</span> any one of it<span class="variation1">s</span> hexagon<span class="variation1">s</span> and who<span class="variation1">s</span>e circumference i<span class="variation1">s</span> inacce<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible.
      <br><br>
      There are five <span class="variation1">s</span>helve<span class="variation1">s</span> for each of the hexagon'<span class="variation1">s</span> wall<span class="variation1">s</span>; each <span class="variation1">s</span>helf contain<span class="variation1">s</span> thirty-five book<span class="variation1">s</span> of uniform format; each book i<span class="variation1">s</span> of four hundred and ten page<span class="variation1">s</span>; each page, of forty line<span class="variation1">s</span>, each line, of <span class="variation1">s</span>ome eighty letter<span class="variation1">s</span> which are black in color. There are al<span class="variation1">s</span>o letter<span class="variation1">s</span> on the <span class="variation1">s</span>pine of each book; the<span class="variation1">s</span>e letter<span class="variation1">s</span> do not indicate or prefigure what the page<span class="variation1">s</span> will <span class="variation1">s</span>ay. I know that thi<span class="variation1">s</span> incoherence at one time <span class="variation1">s</span>eemed my<span class="variation1">s</span>teriou<span class="variation1">s</span>. Before <span class="variation1">s</span>ummarizing the <span class="variation1">s</span>olution (who<span class="variation1">s</span>e di<span class="variation1">s</span>covery, in <span class="variation1">s</span>pite of it<span class="variation1">s</span> tragic projection<span class="variation1">s</span>, i<span class="variation1">s</span> perhap<span class="variation1">s</span> the capital fact in hi<span class="variation1">s</span>tory) I wi<span class="variation1">s</span>h to recall a few axiom<span class="variation1">s</span>.
      <br><br>
      Fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t: The Library exi<span class="variation1">s</span>t<span class="variation1">s</span> ab aeterno. Thi<span class="variation1">s</span> truth, who<span class="variation1">s</span>e immediate corollary i<span class="variation1">s</span> the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any rea<span class="variation1">s</span>onable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the univer<span class="variation1">s</span>e, with it<span class="variation1">s</span> elegant endowment of <span class="variation1">s</span>helve<span class="variation1">s</span>, of enigmatical volume<span class="variation1">s</span>, of inexhau<span class="variation1">s</span>tible <span class="variation1">s</span>tairway<span class="variation1">s</span> for the traveler and latrine<span class="variation1">s</span> for the <span class="variation1">s</span>eated librarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the di<span class="variation1">s</span>tance between the divine and the human, it i<span class="variation1">s</span> enough to compare the<span class="variation1">s</span>e crude wavering <span class="variation1">s</span>ymbol<span class="variation1">s</span> which my fallible hand <span class="variation1">s</span>crawl<span class="variation1">s</span> on the cover of a book, with the organic letter<span class="variation1">s</span> in<span class="variation1">s</span>ide: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably <span class="variation1">s</span>ymmetrical.
      <br><br>
      <span class="variation1">S</span>econd: The orthographical <span class="variation1">s</span>ymbol<span class="variation1">s</span> are twenty-five in number. ^ Thi<span class="variation1">s</span> finding made it po<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible, three hundred year<span class="variation1">s</span> ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and <span class="variation1">s</span>olve <span class="variation1">s</span>ati<span class="variation1">s</span>factorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formle<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> and chaotic nature of almo<span class="variation1">s</span>t all the book<span class="variation1">s</span>. One which my father <span class="variation1">s</span>aw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four wa<span class="variation1">s</span> made up of the letter<span class="variation1">s</span> MCV, perver<span class="variation1">s</span>ely repeated from the fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t line to the la<span class="variation1">s</span>t. Another (very much con<span class="variation1">s</span>ulted in thi<span class="variation1">s</span> area) i<span class="variation1">s</span> a mere labyrinth of letter<span class="variation1">s</span>, but the next-to-la<span class="variation1">s</span>t page <span class="variation1">s</span>ay<span class="variation1">s</span> Oh time thy pyramid<span class="variation1">s</span>. Thi<span class="variation1">s</span> much i<span class="variation1">s</span> already known: for every <span class="variation1">s</span>en<span class="variation1">s</span>ible line of <span class="variation1">s</span>traightforward <span class="variation1">s</span>tatement, there are league<span class="variation1">s</span> of <span class="variation1">s</span>en<span class="variation1">s</span>ele<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> cacophonie<span class="variation1">s</span>, verbal jumble<span class="variation1">s</span> and incoherence<span class="variation1">s</span>. (I know of an uncouth region who<span class="variation1">s</span>e librarian<span class="variation1">s</span> repudiate the vain and <span class="variation1">s</span>uper<span class="variation1">s</span>titiou<span class="variation1">s</span> cu<span class="variation1">s</span>tom of finding a meaning in book<span class="variation1">s</span> and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dream<span class="variation1">s</span> or in the chaotic line<span class="variation1">s</span> of one'<span class="variation1">s</span> palm... They admit that the inventor<span class="variation1">s</span> of thi<span class="variation1">s</span> writing imitated the twenty-five natural <span class="variation1">s</span>ymbol<span class="variation1">s</span>, but maintain that thi<span class="variation1">s</span> application i<span class="variation1">s</span> accidental and that the book<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>ignify nothing in them<span class="variation1">s</span>elve<span class="variation1">s</span>. Thi<span class="variation1">s</span> dictum, we <span class="variation1">s</span>hall <span class="variation1">s</span>ee, i<span class="variation1">s</span> not entirely fallaciou<span class="variation1">s</span>.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it wa<span class="variation1">s</span> believed that the<span class="variation1">s</span>e impenetrable book<span class="variation1">s</span> corre<span class="variation1">s</span>ponded to pa<span class="variation1">s</span>t or remote language<span class="variation1">s</span>. It i<span class="variation1">s</span> true that the mo<span class="variation1">s</span>t ancient men, the fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t librarian<span class="variation1">s</span>, u<span class="variation1">s</span>ed a language quite different from the one we now <span class="variation1">s</span>peak; it i<span class="variation1">s</span> true that a few mile<span class="variation1">s</span> to the right the tongue i<span class="variation1">s</span> dialectical and that ninety floor<span class="variation1">s</span> farther up, it i<span class="variation1">s</span> incomprehen<span class="variation1">s</span>ible. All thi<span class="variation1">s</span>, I repeat, i<span class="variation1">s</span> true, but four hundred and ten page<span class="variation1">s</span> of inalterable MCV'<span class="variation1">s</span> cannot corre<span class="variation1">s</span>pond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. <span class="variation1">S</span>ome in<span class="variation1">s</span>inuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 7 (1) wa<span class="variation1">s</span> not the one the <span class="variation1">s</span>ame <span class="variation1">s</span>erie<span class="variation1">s</span> may have in another po<span class="variation1">s</span>ition on another page, but thi<span class="variation1">s</span> vague the<span class="variation1">s</span>i<span class="variation1">s</span> did not prevail. Other<span class="variation1">s</span> thought of cryptograph<span class="variation1">s</span>; generally, thi<span class="variation1">s</span> conjecture ha<span class="variation1">s</span> been accepted, though not in the <span class="variation1">s</span>en<span class="variation1">s</span>e in which it wa<span class="variation1">s</span> formulated by it<span class="variation1">s</span> originator<span class="variation1">s</span>.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred year<span class="variation1">s</span> ago, the chief of an upper hexagon (2) came upon a book a<span class="variation1">s</span> confu<span class="variation1">s</span>ing a<span class="variation1">s</span> the other<span class="variation1">s</span>, but which had nearly two page<span class="variation1">s</span> of homogeneou<span class="variation1">s</span> line<span class="variation1">s</span>. He <span class="variation1">s</span>howed hi<span class="variation1">s</span> find to a wandering decoder who told him the line<span class="variation1">s</span> were written in Portugue<span class="variation1">s</span>e; other<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>aid they were Yiddi<span class="variation1">s</span>h. Within a century, the language wa<span class="variation1">s</span> e<span class="variation1">s</span>tabli<span class="variation1">s</span>hed: a <span class="variation1">S</span>amoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with cla<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ical Arabian inflection<span class="variation1">s</span>. The content wa<span class="variation1">s</span> al<span class="variation1">s</span>o deciphered: <span class="variation1">s</span>ome notion<span class="variation1">s</span> of combinative analy<span class="variation1">s</span>i<span class="variation1">s</span>, illu<span class="variation1">s</span>trated with example<span class="variation1">s</span> of variation<span class="variation1">s</span> with unlimited repetition. The<span class="variation1">s</span>e example<span class="variation1">s</span> made it po<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible for a librarian of geniu<span class="variation1">s</span> to di<span class="variation1">s</span>cover the fundamental law of the Library. Thi<span class="variation1">s</span> thinker ob<span class="variation1">s</span>erved that all the book<span class="variation1">s</span>, no matter how diver<span class="variation1">s</span>e they might be, are made up of the <span class="variation1">s</span>ame element<span class="variation1">s</span>: the <span class="variation1">s</span>pace, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letter<span class="variation1">s</span> of the alphabet. He al<span class="variation1">s</span>o alleged a fact which traveler<span class="variation1">s</span> have confirmed: In the va<span class="variation1">s</span>t Library there are no two identical book<span class="variation1">s</span>. From the<span class="variation1">s</span>e two incontrovertible premi<span class="variation1">s</span>e<span class="variation1">s</span> he deduced that the Library i<span class="variation1">s</span> total and that it<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>helve<span class="variation1">s</span> regi<span class="variation1">s</span>ter all the po<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible combination<span class="variation1">s</span> of the twenty-odd orthographical <span class="variation1">s</span>ymbol<span class="variation1">s</span> (a number which, though extremely va<span class="variation1">s</span>t, i<span class="variation1">s</span> not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed hi<span class="variation1">s</span>tory of the future, the archangel<span class="variation1">s</span>' autobiographie<span class="variation1">s</span>, the faithful catalogue<span class="variation1">s</span> of the Library, thou<span class="variation1">s</span>and<span class="variation1">s</span> and thou<span class="variation1">s</span>and<span class="variation1">s</span> of fal<span class="variation1">s</span>e catalogue<span class="variation1">s</span>, the demon<span class="variation1">s</span>tration of the fallacy of tho<span class="variation1">s</span>e catalogue<span class="variation1">s</span>, the demon<span class="variation1">s</span>tration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gno<span class="variation1">s</span>tic go<span class="variation1">s</span>pel of Ba<span class="variation1">s</span>ilide<span class="variation1">s</span>, the commentary on that go<span class="variation1">s</span>pel, the commentary on the commentary on that go<span class="variation1">s</span>pel, the true <span class="variation1">s</span>tory of your death, the tran<span class="variation1">s</span>lation of every book in all language<span class="variation1">s</span>, the interpolation<span class="variation1">s</span> of every book in all book<span class="variation1">s</span>.
      <br><br>
      When it wa<span class="variation1">s</span> proclaimed that the Library contained all book<span class="variation1">s</span>, the fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t impre<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ion wa<span class="variation1">s</span> one of extravagant happine<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>. All men felt them<span class="variation1">s</span>elve<span class="variation1">s</span> to be the ma<span class="variation1">s</span>ter<span class="variation1">s</span> of an intact and <span class="variation1">s</span>ecret trea<span class="variation1">s</span>ure. There wa<span class="variation1">s</span> no per<span class="variation1">s</span>onal or world problem who<span class="variation1">s</span>e eloquent <span class="variation1">s</span>olution did not exi<span class="variation1">s</span>t in <span class="variation1">s</span>ome hexagon. The univer<span class="variation1">s</span>e wa<span class="variation1">s</span> ju<span class="variation1">s</span>tified, the univer<span class="variation1">s</span>e <span class="variation1">s</span>uddenly u<span class="variation1">s</span>urped the unlimited dimen<span class="variation1">s</span>ion<span class="variation1">s</span> of hope. At that time a great deal wa<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>aid about the Vindication<span class="variation1">s</span>: book<span class="variation1">s</span> of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the act<span class="variation1">s</span> of every man in the univer<span class="variation1">s</span>e and retained prodigiou<span class="variation1">s</span> arcana for hi<span class="variation1">s</span> future. Thou<span class="variation1">s</span>and<span class="variation1">s</span> of the greedy abandoned their <span class="variation1">s</span>weet native hexagon<span class="variation1">s</span> and ru<span class="variation1">s</span>hed up the <span class="variation1">s</span>tairway<span class="variation1">s</span>, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. The<span class="variation1">s</span>e pilgrim<span class="variation1">s</span> di<span class="variation1">s</span>puted in the narrow corridor<span class="variation1">s</span>, proferred dark cur<span class="variation1">s</span>e<span class="variation1">s</span>, <span class="variation1">s</span>trangled each other on the divine <span class="variation1">s</span>tairway<span class="variation1">s</span>, flung the deceptive book<span class="variation1">s</span> into the air <span class="variation1">s</span>haft<span class="variation1">s</span>, met their death ca<span class="variation1">s</span>t down in a <span class="variation1">s</span>imilar fa<span class="variation1">s</span>hion by the inhabitant<span class="variation1">s</span> of remote region<span class="variation1">s</span>. Other<span class="variation1">s</span> went mad... The Vindication<span class="variation1">s</span> exi<span class="variation1">s</span>t (I have <span class="variation1">s</span>een two which refer to per<span class="variation1">s</span>on<span class="variation1">s</span> of the future, to per<span class="variation1">s</span>on<span class="variation1">s</span> who are perhap<span class="variation1">s</span> not imaginary) but the <span class="variation1">s</span>earcher<span class="variation1">s</span> did not remember that the po<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ibility of a man'<span class="variation1">s</span> finding hi<span class="variation1">s</span> Vindication, or <span class="variation1">s</span>ome treacherou<span class="variation1">s</span> variation thereof, can be computed a<span class="variation1">s</span> zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it wa<span class="variation1">s</span> al<span class="variation1">s</span>o hoped that a clarification of humanity'<span class="variation1">s</span> ba<span class="variation1">s</span>ic my<span class="variation1">s</span>terie<span class="variation1">s</span> - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It i<span class="variation1">s</span> veri<span class="variation1">s</span>imilar that the<span class="variation1">s</span>e grave my<span class="variation1">s</span>terie<span class="variation1">s</span> could be explained in word<span class="variation1">s</span>: if the language of philo<span class="variation1">s</span>opher<span class="variation1">s</span> i<span class="variation1">s</span> not <span class="variation1">s</span>ufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented language required, with it<span class="variation1">s</span> vocabularie<span class="variation1">s</span> and grammar<span class="variation1">s</span>. For four centurie<span class="variation1">s</span> now men have exhau<span class="variation1">s</span>ted the hexagon<span class="variation1">s</span>... There are official <span class="variation1">s</span>earcher<span class="variation1">s</span>, inqui<span class="variation1">s</span>itor<span class="variation1">s</span>. I have <span class="variation1">s</span>een them in the performance of their function: they alway<span class="variation1">s</span> arrive extremely tired from their journey<span class="variation1">s</span>; they <span class="variation1">s</span>peak of a broken <span class="variation1">s</span>tairway which almo<span class="variation1">s</span>t killed them; they talk with the librarian of gallerie<span class="variation1">s</span> and <span class="variation1">s</span>tair<span class="variation1">s</span>; <span class="variation1">s</span>ometime<span class="variation1">s</span> they pick up the neare<span class="variation1">s</span>t volume and leaf through it, looking for infamou<span class="variation1">s</span> word<span class="variation1">s</span>. Obviou<span class="variation1">s</span>ly, no one expect<span class="variation1">s</span> to di<span class="variation1">s</span>cover anything.

      A<span class="variation1">s</span> wa<span class="variation1">s</span> natural, thi<span class="variation1">s</span> inordinate hope wa<span class="variation1">s</span> followed by an exce<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ive depre<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ion. The certitude that <span class="variation1">s</span>ome <span class="variation1">s</span>helf in <span class="variation1">s</span>ome hexagon held preciou<span class="variation1">s</span> book<span class="variation1">s</span> and that the<span class="variation1">s</span>e preciou<span class="variation1">s</span> book<span class="variation1">s</span> were inacce<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible, <span class="variation1">s</span>eemed almo<span class="variation1">s</span>t intolerable. A bla<span class="variation1">s</span>phemou<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>ect <span class="variation1">s</span>ugge<span class="variation1">s</span>ted that the <span class="variation1">s</span>earche<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>hould cea<span class="variation1">s</span>e and that all men <span class="variation1">s</span>hould juggle letter<span class="variation1">s</span> and <span class="variation1">s</span>ymbol<span class="variation1">s</span> until they con<span class="variation1">s</span>tructed, by an improbable gift of chance, the<span class="variation1">s</span>e canonical book<span class="variation1">s</span>. The authoritie<span class="variation1">s</span> were obliged to i<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ue <span class="variation1">s</span>evere order<span class="variation1">s</span>. The <span class="variation1">s</span>ect di<span class="variation1">s</span>appeared, but in my childhood I have <span class="variation1">s</span>een old men who, for long period<span class="variation1">s</span> of time, would hide in the latrine<span class="variation1">s</span> with <span class="variation1">s</span>ome metal di<span class="variation1">s</span>k<span class="variation1">s</span> in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine di<span class="variation1">s</span>order.
      <br><br>
      Other<span class="variation1">s</span>, inver<span class="variation1">s</span>ely, believed that it wa<span class="variation1">s</span> fundamental to eliminate u<span class="variation1">s</span>ele<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> work<span class="variation1">s</span>. They invaded the hexagon<span class="variation1">s</span>, <span class="variation1">s</span>howed credential<span class="variation1">s</span> which were not alway<span class="variation1">s</span> fal<span class="variation1">s</span>e, leafed through a volume with di<span class="variation1">s</span>plea<span class="variation1">s</span>ure and condemned whole <span class="variation1">s</span>helve<span class="variation1">s</span>: their hygienic, a<span class="variation1">s</span>cetic furor cau<span class="variation1">s</span>ed the <span class="variation1">s</span>en<span class="variation1">s</span>ele<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> perdition of million<span class="variation1">s</span> of book<span class="variation1">s</span>. Their name i<span class="variation1">s</span> execrated, but tho<span class="variation1">s</span>e who deplore the "trea<span class="variation1">s</span>ure<span class="variation1">s</span>" de<span class="variation1">s</span>troyed by thi<span class="variation1">s</span> frenzy neglect two notable fact<span class="variation1">s</span>. One: the Library i<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>o enormou<span class="variation1">s</span> that any reduction of human origin i<span class="variation1">s</span> infinite<span class="variation1">s</span>imal. The other: every copy i<span class="variation1">s</span> unique, irreplaceable, but (<span class="variation1">s</span>ince the Library i<span class="variation1">s</span> total) there are alway<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>everal hundred thou<span class="variation1">s</span>and imperfect fac<span class="variation1">s</span>imile<span class="variation1">s</span>: work<span class="variation1">s</span> which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to <span class="variation1">s</span>uppo<span class="variation1">s</span>e that the con<span class="variation1">s</span>equence<span class="variation1">s</span> of the Purifier<span class="variation1">s</span>' depredation<span class="variation1">s</span> have been exaggerated by the horror the<span class="variation1">s</span>e fanatic<span class="variation1">s</span> produced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the book<span class="variation1">s</span> in the Crim<span class="variation1">s</span>on Hexagon: book<span class="variation1">s</span> who<span class="variation1">s</span>e format i<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>maller than u<span class="variation1">s</span>ual, all-powerful, illu<span class="variation1">s</span>trated and magical.

      We al<span class="variation1">s</span>o know of another <span class="variation1">s</span>uper<span class="variation1">s</span>tition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On <span class="variation1">s</span>ome <span class="variation1">s</span>helf in <span class="variation1">s</span>ome hexagon (men rea<span class="variation1">s</span>oned) there mu<span class="variation1">s</span>t exi<span class="variation1">s</span>t a book which i<span class="variation1">s</span> the formula and perfect compendium of all the re<span class="variation1">s</span>t: <span class="variation1">s</span>ome librarian ha<span class="variation1">s</span> gone through it and he i<span class="variation1">s</span> analogou<span class="variation1">s</span> to a god. In the language of thi<span class="variation1">s</span> zone ve<span class="variation1">s</span>tige<span class="variation1">s</span> of thi<span class="variation1">s</span> remote functionary'<span class="variation1">s</span> cult <span class="variation1">s</span>till per<span class="variation1">s</span>i<span class="variation1">s</span>t. Many wandered in <span class="variation1">s</span>earch of Him. For a century they have exhau<span class="variation1">s</span>ted in vain the mo<span class="variation1">s</span>t varied area<span class="variation1">s</span>. How could one locate the venerated and <span class="variation1">s</span>ecret hexagon which hou<span class="variation1">s</span>ed Him? <span class="variation1">S</span>omeone propo<span class="variation1">s</span>ed a regre<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ive method: To locate book A, con<span class="variation1">s</span>ult fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t book B which indicate<span class="variation1">s</span> A'<span class="variation1">s</span> po<span class="variation1">s</span>ition; to locate book B, con<span class="variation1">s</span>ult fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t a book C, and <span class="variation1">s</span>o on to infinity... In adventure<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>uch a<span class="variation1">s</span> the<span class="variation1">s</span>e, I have <span class="variation1">s</span>quandered and wa<span class="variation1">s</span>ted my year<span class="variation1">s</span>. It doe<span class="variation1">s</span> not <span class="variation1">s</span>eem unlikely to me that there i<span class="variation1">s</span> a total book on <span class="variation1">s</span>ome <span class="variation1">s</span>helf of the univer<span class="variation1">s</span>e (3) ; I pray to the unknown god<span class="variation1">s</span> that a man - ju<span class="variation1">s</span>t one, even though it were thou<span class="variation1">s</span>and<span class="variation1">s</span> of year<span class="variation1">s</span> ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wi<span class="variation1">s</span>dom and happine<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> are not for me, let them be for other<span class="variation1">s</span>. Let heaven exi<span class="variation1">s</span>t, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one in<span class="variation1">s</span>tant, in one being, let Your enormou<span class="variation1">s</span> Library be ju<span class="variation1">s</span>tified. The impiou<span class="variation1">s</span> maintain that non<span class="variation1">s</span>en<span class="variation1">s</span>e i<span class="variation1">s</span> normal in the Library and that the rea<span class="variation1">s</span>onable (and even humble and pure coherence) i<span class="variation1">s</span> an almo<span class="variation1">s</span>t miraculou<span class="variation1">s</span> exception. They <span class="variation1">s</span>peak (I know) of the "feveri<span class="variation1">s</span>h Library who<span class="variation1">s</span>e chance volume<span class="variation1">s</span> are con<span class="variation1">s</span>tantly in danger of changing into other<span class="variation1">s</span> and affirm, negate and confu<span class="variation1">s</span>e everything like a deliriou<span class="variation1">s</span> divinity." The<span class="variation1">s</span>e word<span class="variation1">s</span>, which not only denounce the di<span class="variation1">s</span>order but exemplify it a<span class="variation1">s</span> well, notoriou<span class="variation1">s</span>ly prove their author<span class="variation1">s</span>' abominable ta<span class="variation1">s</span>te and de<span class="variation1">s</span>perate ignorance. In truth, the Library include<span class="variation1">s</span> all verbal <span class="variation1">s</span>tructure<span class="variation1">s</span>, all variation<span class="variation1">s</span> permitted by the twenty-five orthographical <span class="variation1">s</span>ymbol<span class="variation1">s</span>, but not a <span class="variation1">s</span>ingle example of ab<span class="variation1">s</span>olute non<span class="variation1">s</span>en<span class="variation1">s</span>e. It i<span class="variation1">s</span> u<span class="variation1">s</span>ele<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> to ob<span class="variation1">s</span>erve that the be<span class="variation1">s</span>t volume of the many hexagon<span class="variation1">s</span> under my admini<span class="variation1">s</span>tration i<span class="variation1">s</span> entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Pla<span class="variation1">s</span>ter Cramp and another Axaxaxa<span class="variation1">s</span> mlo. The<span class="variation1">s</span>e phra<span class="variation1">s</span>e<span class="variation1">s</span>, at fir<span class="variation1">s</span>t glance incoherent, can no doubt be ju<span class="variation1">s</span>tified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; <span class="variation1">s</span>uch a ju<span class="variation1">s</span>tification i<span class="variation1">s</span> verbal and, ex hypothe<span class="variation1">s</span>i, already figure<span class="variation1">s</span> in the Library.

No one can articulate a <span class="variation1">s</span>yllable which i<span class="variation1">s</span> not filled with tenderne<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> and fear, which i<span class="variation1">s</span> not, in one of the<span class="variation1">s</span>e language<span class="variation1">s</span>, the powerful name of a god.

(An n number of po<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible language<span class="variation1">s</span> u<span class="variation1">s</span>e the <span class="variation1">s</span>ame vocabulary; in <span class="variation1">s</span>ome of them, the <span class="variation1">s</span>ymbol library allow<span class="variation1">s</span> the correct definition a ubiquitou<span class="variation1">s</span> and la<span class="variation1">s</span>ting <span class="variation1">s</span>y<span class="variation1">s</span>tem of hexagonal gallerie<span class="variation1">s</span>, but library i<span class="variation1">s</span> bread or pyramid or anything el<span class="variation1">s</span>e, and the<span class="variation1">s</span>e <span class="variation1">s</span>even word<span class="variation1">s</span> which define it have another value.

      <br><br>
      The methodical ta<span class="variation1">s</span>k of writing di<span class="variation1">s</span>tract<span class="variation1">s</span> me from the pre<span class="variation1">s</span>ent <span class="variation1">s</span>tate of men. The certitude that everything ha<span class="variation1">s</span> been written negate<span class="variation1">s</span> u<span class="variation1">s</span> or turn<span class="variation1">s</span> u<span class="variation1">s</span> into phantom<span class="variation1">s</span>. I know of di<span class="variation1">s</span>trict<span class="variation1">s</span> in which the young men pro<span class="variation1">s</span>trate them<span class="variation1">s</span>elve<span class="variation1">s</span> before book<span class="variation1">s</span> and ki<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> their page<span class="variation1">s</span> in a barbarou<span class="variation1">s</span> manner, but they do not know how to decipher a <span class="variation1">s</span>ingle letter. Epidemic<span class="variation1">s</span>, heretical conflict<span class="variation1">s</span>, peregrination<span class="variation1">s</span> which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned <span class="variation1">s</span>uicide<span class="variation1">s</span>, more and more frequent with the year<span class="variation1">s</span>. Perhap<span class="variation1">s</span> my old age and fearfulne<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> deceive me, but I <span class="variation1">s</span>u<span class="variation1">s</span>pect that the human <span class="variation1">s</span>pecie<span class="variation1">s</span> - the unique <span class="variation1">s</span>pecie<span class="variation1">s</span> - i<span class="variation1">s</span> about to be extingui<span class="variation1">s</span>hed, but the Library will endure: illuminated, <span class="variation1">s</span>olitary, infinite, perfectly motionle<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>, equipped with preciou<span class="variation1">s</span> volume<span class="variation1">s</span>, u<span class="variation1">s</span>ele<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>, incorruptible, <span class="variation1">s</span>ecret.
      <br><br>
      I have ju<span class="variation1">s</span>t written the word "infinite".' I have not interpolated thi<span class="variation1">s</span> adjective out of rhetorical habit; I <span class="variation1">s</span>ay that it i<span class="variation1">s</span> not illogical to think that the world i<span class="variation1">s</span> infinite. Tho<span class="variation1">s</span>e who judge it to be limited po<span class="variation1">s</span>tulate that in remote place<span class="variation1">s</span> the corridor<span class="variation1">s</span> and <span class="variation1">s</span>tairway<span class="variation1">s</span> and hexagon<span class="variation1">s</span> can conceivably come to an end - which i<span class="variation1">s</span> ab<span class="variation1">s</span>urd. Tho<span class="variation1">s</span>e who imagine it to be without limit forget that the po<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible number of book<span class="variation1">s</span> doe<span class="variation1">s</span> have <span class="variation1">s</span>uch a limit. I venture to <span class="variation1">s</span>ugge<span class="variation1">s</span>t thi<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>olution to the ancient problem: The Library i<span class="variation1">s</span> unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cro<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> it in any direction, after centurie<span class="variation1">s</span> he would <span class="variation1">s</span>ee that the <span class="variation1">s</span>ame volume<span class="variation1">s</span> were repeated in the <span class="variation1">s</span>ame di<span class="variation1">s</span>order (which, thu<span class="variation1">s</span> repeated, would be an order: the Order). My <span class="variation1">s</span>olitude i<span class="variation1">s</span> gladdened by thi<span class="variation1">s</span> elegant hope (4).

      1. The original manu<span class="variation1">s</span>cript doe<span class="variation1">s</span> not contain digit<span class="variation1">s</span> or capital letter<span class="variation1">s</span>. The punctuation ha<span class="variation1">s</span> been limited to the comma and the period. The<span class="variation1">s</span>e two <span class="variation1">s</span>ign<span class="variation1">s</span>, the <span class="variation1">s</span>pace and the twenty-two letter<span class="variation1">s</span> of the alphabet are the twenty-five <span class="variation1">s</span>ymbol<span class="variation1">s</span> con<span class="variation1">s</span>idered <span class="variation1">s</span>ufficient by thi<span class="variation1">s</span> unknown author.

      3. I repeat: it <span class="variation1">s</span>uffice<span class="variation1">s</span> that a book be po<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible for it to exi<span class="variation1">s</span>t. Only the impo<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ible i<span class="variation1">s</span> excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are book<span class="variation1">s</span> which di<span class="variation1">s</span>cu<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span> and negate and demon<span class="variation1">s</span>trate thi<span class="variation1">s</span> po<span class="variation1">s</span><span class="variation1">s</span>ibility and other<span class="variation1">s</span> who<span class="variation1">s</span>e <span class="variation1">s</span>tructure corre<span class="variation1">s</span>pond<span class="variation1">s</span> to that of a ladder.

The handling of thi<span class="variation1">s</span> <span class="variation1">s</span>ilky vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold into other analogou<span class="variation1">s</span> one<span class="variation1">s</span>; the inconceivable middle page would have no rever<span class="variation1">s</span>e.
