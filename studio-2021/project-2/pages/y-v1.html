      B<span class="variation1">y</span> this art <span class="variation1">y</span>ou ma<span class="variation1">y</span> contemplate the variations of the 23 letters...
      The Anatom<span class="variation1">y</span> of Melanchol<span class="variation1">y</span>, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which others call the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span>) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded b<span class="variation1">y</span> ver<span class="variation1">y</span> low railings. From an<span class="variation1">y</span> of the hexagons one can see, interminabl<span class="variation1">y</span>, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twent<span class="variation1">y</span> shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcel<span class="variation1">y</span> exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallwa<span class="variation1">y</span> which opens onto another galler<span class="variation1">y</span>, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallwa<span class="variation1">y</span> there are two ver<span class="variation1">y</span> small closets. In the first, one ma<span class="variation1">y</span> sleep standing up; in the other, satisf<span class="variation1">y</span> one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairwa<span class="variation1">y</span>, which sinks ab<span class="variation1">y</span>small<span class="variation1">y</span> and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallwa<span class="variation1">y</span> there is a mirror which faithfull<span class="variation1">y</span> duplicates all appearances. Men usuall<span class="variation1">y</span> infer from this mirror that the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is not infinite (if it were, wh<span class="variation1">y</span> this illusor<span class="variation1">y</span> duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided b<span class="variation1">y</span> some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversall<span class="variation1">y</span> placed, in each hexagon. The light the<span class="variation1">y</span> emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span>, I have traveled in m<span class="variation1">y</span> <span class="variation1">y</span>outh; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that m<span class="variation1">y</span> e<span class="variation1">y</span>es can hardl<span class="variation1">y</span> decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; m<span class="variation1">y</span> grave will be the fathomless air; m<span class="variation1">y</span> bod<span class="variation1">y</span> will sink endlessl<span class="variation1">y</span> and deca<span class="variation1">y</span> and dissolve in the wind generated b<span class="variation1">y</span> the fall, which is infinite. I sa<span class="variation1">y</span> that the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessar<span class="variation1">y</span> form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. The<span class="variation1">y</span> reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The m<span class="variation1">y</span>stics claim that their ecstas<span class="variation1">y</span> reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimon<span class="variation1">y</span> is suspect; their words, obscure. This c<span class="variation1">y</span>clical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is a sphere whose exact center is an<span class="variation1">y</span> one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirt<span class="variation1">y</span>-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of fort<span class="variation1">y</span> lines, each line, of some eight<span class="variation1">y</span> letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will sa<span class="variation1">y</span>. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed m<span class="variation1">y</span>sterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discover<span class="variation1">y</span>, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in histor<span class="variation1">y</span>) I wish to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollar<span class="variation1">y</span> is the future eternit<span class="variation1">y</span> of the world, cannot be placed in doubt b<span class="variation1">y</span> an<span class="variation1">y</span> reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, ma<span class="variation1">y</span> be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairwa<span class="variation1">y</span>s for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can onl<span class="variation1">y</span> be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering s<span class="variation1">y</span>mbols which m<span class="variation1">y</span> fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectl<span class="variation1">y</span> black, inimitabl<span class="variation1">y</span> s<span class="variation1">y</span>mmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthographical s<span class="variation1">y</span>mbols are twent<span class="variation1">y</span>-five in number. ^ This finding made it possible, three hundred <span class="variation1">y</span>ears ago, to formulate a general theor<span class="variation1">y</span> of the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> and solve satisfactoril<span class="variation1">y</span> the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which m<span class="variation1">y</span> father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninet<span class="variation1">y</span>-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversel<span class="variation1">y</span> repeated from the first line to the last. Another (ver<span class="variation1">y</span> much consulted in this area) is a mere lab<span class="variation1">y</span>rinth of letters, but the next-to-last page sa<span class="variation1">y</span>s Oh time th<span class="variation1">y</span> p<span class="variation1">y</span>ramids. This much is alread<span class="variation1">y</span> known: for ever<span class="variation1">y</span> sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... The<span class="variation1">y</span> admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twent<span class="variation1">y</span>-five natural s<span class="variation1">y</span>mbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signif<span class="variation1">y</span> nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirel<span class="variation1">y</span> fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninet<span class="variation1">y</span> floors farther up, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to an<span class="variation1">y</span> language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentar<span class="variation1">y</span> it ma<span class="variation1">y</span> be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 7 (1) was not the one the same series ma<span class="variation1">y</span> have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cr<span class="variation1">y</span>ptographs; generall<span class="variation1">y</span>, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated b<span class="variation1">y</span> its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred <span class="variation1">y</span>ears ago, the chief of an upper hexagon (2) came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearl<span class="variation1">y</span> two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said the<span class="variation1">y</span> were <span class="variation1">Y</span>iddish. Within a centur<span class="variation1">y</span>, the language was established: a Samo<span class="variation1">y</span>edic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative anal<span class="variation1">y</span>sis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span>. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse the<span class="variation1">y</span> might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twent<span class="variation1">y</span>-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> there are no two identical books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twent<span class="variation1">y</span>-odd orthographical s<span class="variation1">y</span>mbols (a number which, though extremel<span class="variation1">y</span> vast, is not infinite): Ever<span class="variation1">y</span>thing: the minutel<span class="variation1">y</span> detailed histor<span class="variation1">y</span> of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span>, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallac<span class="variation1">y</span> of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallac<span class="variation1">y</span> of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentar<span class="variation1">y</span> on that gospel, the commentar<span class="variation1">y</span> on the commentar<span class="variation1">y</span> on that gospel, the true stor<span class="variation1">y</span> of <span class="variation1">y</span>our death, the translation of ever<span class="variation1">y</span> book in all languages, the interpolations of ever<span class="variation1">y</span> book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was proclaimed that the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenl<span class="variation1">y</span> usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apolog<span class="variation1">y</span> and prophec<span class="variation1">y</span> which vindicated for all time the acts of ever<span class="variation1">y</span> man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greed<span class="variation1">y</span> abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairwa<span class="variation1">y</span>s, urged on b<span class="variation1">y</span> the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairwa<span class="variation1">y</span>s, flung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion b<span class="variation1">y</span> the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginar<span class="variation1">y</span>) but the searchers did not remember that the possibilit<span class="variation1">y</span> of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanit<span class="variation1">y</span>'s basic m<span class="variation1">y</span>steries - the origin of the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> and of time - might be found. It is verisimilar that these grave m<span class="variation1">y</span>steries could be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: the<span class="variation1">y</span> alwa<span class="variation1">y</span>s arrive extremel<span class="variation1">y</span> tired from their journe<span class="variation1">y</span>s; the<span class="variation1">y</span> speak of a broken stairwa<span class="variation1">y</span> which almost killed them; the<span class="variation1">y</span> talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes the<span class="variation1">y</span> pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. Obviousl<span class="variation1">y</span>, no one expects to discover an<span class="variation1">y</span>thing.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed b<span class="variation1">y</span> an excessive depression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and s<span class="variation1">y</span>mbols until the<span class="variation1">y</span> constructed, b<span class="variation1">y</span> an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in m<span class="variation1">y</span> childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebl<span class="variation1">y</span> mimic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversel<span class="variation1">y</span>, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. The<span class="variation1">y</span> invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not alwa<span class="variation1">y</span>s false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their h<span class="variation1">y</span>gienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destro<span class="variation1">y</span>ed b<span class="variation1">y</span> this frenz<span class="variation1">y</span> neglect two notable facts. One: the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is so enormous that an<span class="variation1">y</span> reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: ever<span class="variation1">y</span> cop<span class="variation1">y</span> is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is total) there are alwa<span class="variation1">y</span>s several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ onl<span class="variation1">y</span> in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated b<span class="variation1">y</span> the horror these fanatics produced. The<span class="variation1">y</span> were urged on b<span class="variation1">y</span> the delirium of tr<span class="variation1">y</span>ing to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionar<span class="variation1">y</span>'s cult still persist. Man<span class="variation1">y</span> wandered in search of Him. For a centur<span class="variation1">y</span> the<span class="variation1">y</span> have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinit<span class="variation1">y</span>... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted m<span class="variation1">y</span> <span class="variation1">y</span>ears. It does not seem unlikel<span class="variation1">y</span> to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe (3) ; I pra<span class="variation1">y</span> to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of <span class="variation1">y</span>ears ago! - ma<span class="variation1">y</span> have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though m<span class="variation1">y</span> place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let <span class="variation1">Y</span>our enormous Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. The<span class="variation1">y</span> speak (I know) of the "feverish Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> whose chance volumes are constantl<span class="variation1">y</span> in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse ever<span class="variation1">y</span>thing like a delirious divinit<span class="variation1">y</span>." These words, which not onl<span class="variation1">y</span> denounce the disorder but exemplif<span class="variation1">y</span> it as well, notoriousl<span class="variation1">y</span> prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted b<span class="variation1">y</span> the twent<span class="variation1">y</span>-five orthographical s<span class="variation1">y</span>mbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the man<span class="variation1">y</span> hexagons under m<span class="variation1">y</span> administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cr<span class="variation1">y</span>ptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex h<span class="variation1">y</span>pothesi, alread<span class="variation1">y</span> figures in the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span>. I cannot combine some characters
      <br><br>
      dhcmrlchtdj
      <br><br>
      which the divine Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a s<span class="variation1">y</span>llable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautolog<span class="variation1">y</span>. This word<span class="variation1">y</span> and useless epistle alread<span class="variation1">y</span> exists in one of the thirt<span class="variation1">y</span> volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of possible languages use the same vocabular<span class="variation1">y</span>; in some of them, the s<span class="variation1">y</span>mbol librar<span class="variation1">y</span> allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting s<span class="variation1">y</span>stem of hexagonal galleries, but librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is bread or p<span class="variation1">y</span>ramid or an<span class="variation1">y</span>thing else, and these seven words which define it have another value. <span class="variation1">Y</span>ou who read me, are <span class="variation1">Y</span>ou sure of understanding m<span class="variation1">y</span> language?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that ever<span class="variation1">y</span>thing has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the <span class="variation1">y</span>oung men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but the<span class="variation1">y</span> do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitabl<span class="variation1">y</span> degenerate into banditr<span class="variation1">y</span>, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the <span class="variation1">y</span>ears. Perhaps m<span class="variation1">y</span> old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> will endure: illuminated, solitar<span class="variation1">y</span>, infinite, perfectl<span class="variation1">y</span> motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the word "infinite".' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I sa<span class="variation1">y</span> that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairwa<span class="variation1">y</span>s and hexagons can conceivabl<span class="variation1">y</span> come to an end - which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is unlimited and c<span class="variation1">y</span>clical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in an<span class="variation1">y</span> direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). M<span class="variation1">y</span> solitude is gladdened b<span class="variation1">y</span> this elegant hope (4).
      <br><br>
      Translated b<span class="variation1">y</span> J. E. I.
      <br><br>
      1. The original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation has been limited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twent<span class="variation1">y</span>-two letters of the alphabet are the twent<span class="variation1">y</span>-five s<span class="variation1">y</span>mbols considered sufficient b<span class="variation1">y</span> this unknown author. (Editor's note.)
      <br><br>
      2. Before, there was a man for ever<span class="variation1">y</span> three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonar<span class="variation1">y</span> diseases have destro<span class="variation1">y</span>ed that proportion. A memor<span class="variation1">y</span> of unspeakable melanchol<span class="variation1">y</span>: at times I have traveled for man<span class="variation1">y</span> nights through corridors and along polished stairwa<span class="variation1">y</span>s without finding a single librarian.
      <br><br>
      3. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Onl<span class="variation1">y</span> the impossible is excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate and demonstrate this possibilit<span class="variation1">y</span> and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.
      <br><br>
      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Librar<span class="variation1">y</span> is useless: rigorousl<span class="variation1">y</span> speaking, a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinar<span class="variation1">y</span> format, printed in nine or ten point t<span class="variation1">y</span>pe, containing an infinite number if infinitel<span class="variation1">y</span> thin leaves. (In the earl<span class="variation1">y</span> seventeenth centur<span class="variation1">y</span>, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of this silk<span class="variation1">y</span> vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold into other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.
