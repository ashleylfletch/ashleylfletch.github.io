      <span class="variation2">T</span>he universe (which o<span class="variation2">t</span>hers call <span class="variation2">t</span>he Library) is composed of an indefini<span class="variation2">t</span>e and perhaps infini<span class="variation2">t</span>e number of hexagonal galleries, wi<span class="variation2">t</span>h vas<span class="variation2">t</span> air shaf<span class="variation2">t</span>s be<span class="variation2">t</span>ween, surrounded by very low railings. From any of <span class="variation2">t</span>he hexagons one can see, in<span class="variation2">t</span>erminably, <span class="variation2">t</span>he upper and lower floors. <span class="variation2">T</span>he dis<span class="variation2">t</span>ribu<span class="variation2">t</span>ion of <span class="variation2">t</span>he galleries is invariable. <span class="variation2">T</span>wen<span class="variation2">t</span>y shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all <span class="variation2">t</span>he sides excep<span class="variation2">t</span> <span class="variation2">t</span>wo; <span class="variation2">t</span>heir heigh<span class="variation2">t</span>, which is <span class="variation2">t</span>he dis<span class="variation2">t</span>ance from floor <span class="variation2">t</span>o ceiling, scarcely exceeds <span class="variation2">t</span>ha<span class="variation2">t</span> of a normal bookcase.

In <span class="variation2">t</span>he hallway <span class="variation2">t</span>here is a mirror which fai<span class="variation2">t</span>hfully duplica<span class="variation2">t</span>es all appearances.

      Like all men of <span class="variation2">t</span>he Library, I have <span class="variation2">t</span>raveled in my you<span class="variation2">t</span>h; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps <span class="variation2">t</span>he ca<span class="variation2">t</span>alogue of ca<span class="variation2">t</span>alogues; now <span class="variation2">t</span>ha<span class="variation2">t</span> my eyes can hardly decipher wha<span class="variation2">t</span> I wri<span class="variation2">t</span>e, I am preparing <span class="variation2">t</span>o die jus<span class="variation2">t</span> a few leagues from <span class="variation2">t</span>he hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, <span class="variation2">t</span>here will be no lack of pious hands <span class="variation2">t</span>o <span class="variation2">t</span>hrow me over <span class="variation2">t</span>he railing; my grave will be <span class="variation2">t</span>he fa<span class="variation2">t</span>homless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in <span class="variation2">t</span>he wind genera<span class="variation2">t</span>ed by <span class="variation2">t</span>he fall, which is infini<span class="variation2">t</span>e. I say <span class="variation2">t</span>ha<span class="variation2">t</span> <span class="variation2">t</span>he Library is unending. <span class="variation2">T</span>he idealis<span class="variation2">t</span>s argue <span class="variation2">t</span>ha<span class="variation2">t</span> <span class="variation2">t</span>he hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolu<span class="variation2">t</span>e space or, a<span class="variation2">t</span> leas<span class="variation2">t</span>, of our in<span class="variation2">t</span>ui<span class="variation2">t</span>ion of space. <span class="variation2">T</span>hey reason <span class="variation2">t</span>ha<span class="variation2">t</span> a <span class="variation2">t</span>riangular or pen<span class="variation2">t</span>agonal room is inconceivable.
