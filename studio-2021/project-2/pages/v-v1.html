      The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. I<span class="variation1">V</span>
      <br><br>
      The uni<span class="variation1">v</span>erse (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with <span class="variation1">v</span>ast air shafts between, surrounded by <span class="variation1">v</span>ery low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is in<span class="variation1">v</span>ariable. Twenty shel<span class="variation1">v</span>es, fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e long shel<span class="variation1">v</span>es per side, co<span class="variation1">v</span>er all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two <span class="variation1">v</span>ery small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is pro<span class="variation1">v</span>ided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, trans<span class="variation1">v</span>ersally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Library, I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e tra<span class="variation1">v</span>eled in my youth; I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me o<span class="variation1">v</span>er the railing; my gra<span class="variation1">v</span>e will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissol<span class="variation1">v</span>e in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconcei<span class="variation1">v</span>able. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy re<span class="variation1">v</span>eals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.
      <br><br>
      There are fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e shel<span class="variation1">v</span>es for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose disco<span class="variation1">v</span>ery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of male<span class="variation1">v</span>olent demiurgi; the uni<span class="variation1">v</span>erse, with its elegant endowment of shel<span class="variation1">v</span>es, of enigmatical <span class="variation1">v</span>olumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the tra<span class="variation1">v</span>eler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. To percei<span class="variation1">v</span>e the distance between the di<span class="variation1">v</span>ine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wa<span class="variation1">v</span>ering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the co<span class="variation1">v</span>er of a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e in number. ^ This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and sol<span class="variation1">v</span>e satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MC<span class="variation1">V</span>, per<span class="variation1">v</span>ersely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (<span class="variation1">v</span>ery much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for e<span class="variation1">v</span>ery sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, <span class="variation1">v</span>erbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the <span class="variation1">v</span>ain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that the in<span class="variation1">v</span>entors of this writing imitated the twenty-fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themsel<span class="variation1">v</span>es. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it was belie<span class="variation1">v</span>ed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MC<span class="variation1">V</span>'s cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the <span class="variation1">v</span>alue of MC<span class="variation1">V</span> in the third line of page 7 (1) was not the one the same series may ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e in another position on another page, but this <span class="variation1">v</span>ague thesis did not pre<span class="variation1">v</span>ail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.
      <br><br>
      Fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon (2) came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinati<span class="variation1">v</span>e analysis, illustrated with examples of <span class="variation1">v</span>ariations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to disco<span class="variation1">v</span>er the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker obser<span class="variation1">v</span>ed that all the books, no matter how di<span class="variation1">v</span>erse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which tra<span class="variation1">v</span>elers ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e confirmed: In the <span class="variation1">v</span>ast Library there are no two identical books. From these two incontro<span class="variation1">v</span>ertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shel<span class="variation1">v</span>es register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely <span class="variation1">v</span>ast, is not infinite): E<span class="variation1">v</span>erything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of e<span class="variation1">v</span>ery book in all languages, the interpolations of e<span class="variation1">v</span>ery book in all books.
      <br><br>
      When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extra<span class="variation1">v</span>agant happiness. All men felt themsel<span class="variation1">v</span>es to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The uni<span class="variation1">v</span>erse was justified, the uni<span class="variation1">v</span>erse suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the <span class="variation1">V</span>indications: books of apology and prophecy which <span class="variation1">v</span>indicated for all time the acts of e<span class="variation1">v</span>ery man in the uni<span class="variation1">v</span>erse and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet nati<span class="variation1">v</span>e hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the <span class="variation1">v</span>ain intention of finding their <span class="variation1">V</span>indication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the di<span class="variation1">v</span>ine stairways, flung the decepti<span class="variation1">v</span>e books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The <span class="variation1">V</span>indications exist (I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his <span class="variation1">V</span>indication, or some treacherous <span class="variation1">v</span>ariation thereof, can be computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic mysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It is <span class="variation1">v</span>erisimilar that these gra<span class="variation1">v</span>e mysteries could be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e produced the unprecedented language required, with its <span class="variation1">v</span>ocabularies and grammars. For four centuries now men ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e exhausted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e seen them in the performance of their function: they always arri<span class="variation1">v</span>e extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest <span class="variation1">v</span>olume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. Ob<span class="variation1">v</span>iously, no one expects to disco<span class="variation1">v</span>er anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessi<span class="variation1">v</span>e depression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue se<span class="variation1">v</span>ere orders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the di<span class="variation1">v</span>ine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, in<span class="variation1">v</span>ersely, belie<span class="variation1">v</span>ed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They in<span class="variation1">v</span>aded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a <span class="variation1">v</span>olume with displeasure and condemned whole shel<span class="variation1">v</span>es: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: e<span class="variation1">v</span>ery copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always se<span class="variation1">v</span>eral hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I <span class="variation1">v</span>enture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone <span class="variation1">v</span>estiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e exhausted in <span class="variation1">v</span>ain the most <span class="variation1">v</span>aried areas. How could one locate the <span class="variation1">v</span>enerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressi<span class="variation1">v</span>e method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity... In ad<span class="variation1">v</span>entures such as these, I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the uni<span class="variation1">v</span>erse (3) ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, e<span class="variation1">v</span>en though it were thousands of years ago! - may ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let hea<span class="variation1">v</span>en exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and e<span class="variation1">v</span>en humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the "fe<span class="variation1">v</span>erish Library whose chance <span class="variation1">v</span>olumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse e<span class="variation1">v</span>erything like a delirious di<span class="variation1">v</span>inity." These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously pro<span class="variation1">v</span>e their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes all <span class="variation1">v</span>erbal structures, all <span class="variation1">v</span>ariations permitted by the twenty-fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to obser<span class="variation1">v</span>e that the best <span class="variation1">v</span>olume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is <span class="variation1">v</span>erbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      which the di<span class="variation1">v</span>ine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty <span class="variation1">v</span>olumes of the fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e shel<span class="variation1">v</span>es of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of possible languages use the same <span class="variation1">v</span>ocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these se<span class="variation1">v</span>en words which define it ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e another <span class="variation1">v</span>alue. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that e<span class="variation1">v</span>erything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themsel<span class="variation1">v</span>es before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which ine<span class="variation1">v</span>itably degenerate into banditry, ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e decimated the population. I belie<span class="variation1">v</span>e I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old age and fearfulness decei<span class="variation1">v</span>e me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious <span class="variation1">v</span>olumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.
      <br><br>
      I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e just written the word "infinite".' I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e not interpolated this adjecti<span class="variation1">v</span>e out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can concei<span class="variation1">v</span>ably come to an end - which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e such a limit. I <span class="variation1">v</span>enture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal tra<span class="variation1">v</span>eler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same <span class="variation1">v</span>olumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope (4).

      1. The original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation has been limited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the twenty-fi<span class="variation1">v</span>e symbols considered sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's note.)
      <br><br>
      2. Before, there was a man for e<span class="variation1">v</span>ery three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e destroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at times I ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e tra<span class="variation1">v</span>eled for many nights through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a single librarian.
      <br><br>
      3. I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate and demonstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.
      <br><br>
      4. Letizia Al<span class="variation1">v</span>arez de Toledo has obser<span class="variation1">v</span>ed that this <span class="variation1">v</span>ast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a single <span class="variation1">v</span>olume would be sufficient, a <span class="variation1">v</span>olume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinitely thin lea<span class="variation1">v</span>es. (In the early se<span class="variation1">v</span>enteenth century, Ca<span class="variation1">v</span>alieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of this silky <span class="variation1">v</span>ade mecum would not be con<span class="variation1">v</span>enient: each apparent page would unfold into other analogous ones; the inconcei<span class="variation1">v</span>able middle page would ha<span class="variation1">v</span>e no re<span class="variation1">v</span>erse.
