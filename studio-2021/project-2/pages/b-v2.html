      The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
      <br><br>
      The universe (which others call the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite num<span class="variation2">b</span>er of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts <span class="variation2">b</span>etween, surrounded <span class="variation2">b</span>y very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, intermina<span class="variation2">b</span>ly, the upper and lower floors. The distri<span class="variation2">b</span>ution of the galleries is invaria<span class="variation2">b</span>le. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal <span class="variation2">b</span>ookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks a<span class="variation2">b</span>ysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided <span class="variation2">b</span>y some spherical fruit which <span class="variation2">b</span>ear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.
      <br><br>
      Like all men of the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a <span class="variation2">b</span>ook, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was <span class="variation2">b</span>orn. Once I am dead, there will <span class="variation2">b</span>e no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will <span class="variation2">b</span>e the fathomless air; my <span class="variation2">b</span>ody will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated <span class="variation2">b</span>y the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of a<span class="variation2">b</span>solute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceiva<span class="variation2">b</span>le. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular cham<span class="variation2">b</span>er containing a great circular <span class="variation2">b</span>ook, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; <span class="variation2">b</span>ut their testimony is suspect; their words, o<span class="variation2">b</span>scure. This cyclical <span class="variation2">b</span>ook is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessi<span class="variation2">b</span>le.
      <br><br>
      There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks of uniform format; each <span class="variation2">b</span>ook is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are <span class="variation2">b</span>lack in color. There are also letters on the spine of each <span class="variation2">b</span>ook; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. <span class="variation2">B</span>efore summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
      <br><br>
      First: The Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary exists a<span class="variation2">b</span> aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot <span class="variation2">b</span>e placed in dou<span class="variation2">b</span>t <span class="variation2">b</span>y any reasona<span class="variation2">b</span>le mind. Man, the imperfect li<span class="variation2">b</span>rarian, may <span class="variation2">b</span>e the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhausti<span class="variation2">b</span>le stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated li<span class="variation2">b</span>rarian, can only <span class="variation2">b</span>e the work of a god. To perceive the distance <span class="variation2">b</span>etween the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering sym<span class="variation2">b</span>ols which my falli<span class="variation2">b</span>le hand scrawls on the cover of a <span class="variation2">b</span>ook, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly <span class="variation2">b</span>lack, inimita<span class="variation2">b</span>ly symmetrical.
      <br><br>
      Second: The orthographical sym<span class="variation2">b</span>ols are twenty-five in num<span class="variation2">b</span>er.^ This finding made it possi<span class="variation2">b</span>le, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary and solve satisfactorily the pro<span class="variation2">b</span>lem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere la<span class="variation2">b</span>yrinth of letters, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensi<span class="variation2">b</span>le line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, ver<span class="variation2">b</span>al jum<span class="variation2">b</span>les and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose li<span class="variation2">b</span>rarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural sym<span class="variation2">b</span>ols, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut maintain that this application is accidental and that the <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
      <br><br>
      For a long time it was <span class="variation2">b</span>elieved that these impenetra<span class="variation2">b</span>le <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first li<span class="variation2">b</span>rarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensi<span class="variation2">b</span>le. All this, I repeat, is true, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut four hundred and ten pages of inaltera<span class="variation2">b</span>le MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may <span class="variation2">b</span>e. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has <span class="variation2">b</span>een accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated <span class="variation2">b</span>y its originators.
      <br><br>
      Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a <span class="variation2">b</span>ook as confusing as the others, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was esta<span class="variation2">b</span>lished: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Ara<span class="variation2">b</span>ian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of com<span class="variation2">b</span>inative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possi<span class="variation2">b</span>le for a li<span class="variation2">b</span>rarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary. This thinker o<span class="variation2">b</span>served that all the <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks, no matter how diverse they might <span class="variation2">b</span>e, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alpha<span class="variation2">b</span>et. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary there are no two identical <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks. From these two incontroverti<span class="variation2">b</span>le premises he deduced that the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is total and that its shelves register all the possi<span class="variation2">b</span>le com<span class="variation2">b</span>inations of the twenty-odd orthographical sym<span class="variation2">b</span>ols (a num<span class="variation2">b</span>er which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' auto<span class="variation2">b</span>iographies, the faithful catalogues of the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every <span class="variation2">b</span>ook in all languages, the interpolations of every <span class="variation2">b</span>ook in all <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks.
      <br><br>
      When it was proclaimed that the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary contained all <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to <span class="variation2">b</span>e the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world pro<span class="variation2">b</span>lem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said a<span class="variation2">b</span>out the Vindications: <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy a<span class="variation2">b</span>andoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on <span class="variation2">b</span>y the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion <span class="variation2">b</span>y the inha<span class="variation2">b</span>itants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) <span class="variation2">b</span>ut the searchers did not remem<span class="variation2">b</span>er that the possi<span class="variation2">b</span>ility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can <span class="variation2">b</span>e computed as zero.
      <br><br>
      At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's <span class="variation2">b</span>asic mysteries - the origin of the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary and of time - might <span class="variation2">b</span>e found. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could <span class="variation2">b</span>e explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its voca<span class="variation2">b</span>ularies and grammars. For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a <span class="variation2">b</span>roken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the li<span class="variation2">b</span>rarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. O<span class="variation2">b</span>viously, no one expects to discover anything.
      <br><br>
      As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed <span class="variation2">b</span>y an excessive depression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks and that these precious <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks were inaccessi<span class="variation2">b</span>le, seemed almost intolera<span class="variation2">b</span>le. A <span class="variation2">b</span>lasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and sym<span class="variation2">b</span>ols until they constructed, <span class="variation2">b</span>y an impro<span class="variation2">b</span>a<span class="variation2">b</span>le gift of chance, these canonical <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks. The authorities were o<span class="variation2">b</span>liged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a for<span class="variation2">b</span>idden dice cup and fee<span class="variation2">b</span>ly mimic the divine disorder.
      <br><br>
      Others, inversely, <span class="variation2">b</span>elieved that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks. Their name is execrated, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed <span class="variation2">b</span>y this frenzy neglect two nota<span class="variation2">b</span>le facts. One: the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique, irreplacea<span class="variation2">b</span>le, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut (since the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is total) there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have <span class="variation2">b</span>een exaggerated <span class="variation2">b</span>y the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on <span class="variation2">b</span>y the delirium of trying to reach the <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks in the Crimson Hexagon: <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.
      <br><br>
      We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a <span class="variation2">b</span>ook which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some li<span class="variation2">b</span>rarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate <span class="variation2">b</span>ook A, consult first <span class="variation2">b</span>ook B which indicates A's position; to locate <span class="variation2">b</span>ook B, consult first a <span class="variation2">b</span>ook C, and so on to infinity... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total <span class="variation2">b</span>ook on some shelf of the universe 3 ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them <span class="variation2">b</span>e for others. Let heaven exist, though my place <span class="variation2">b</span>e in hell. Let me <span class="variation2">b</span>e outraged and annihilated, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut for one instant, in one <span class="variation2">b</span>eing, let Your enormous Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary <span class="variation2">b</span>e justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary and that the reasona<span class="variation2">b</span>le (and even hum<span class="variation2">b</span>le and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the "feverish Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity." These words, which not only denounce the disorder <span class="variation2">b</span>ut exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' a<span class="variation2">b</span>omina<span class="variation2">b</span>le taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary includes all ver<span class="variation2">b</span>al structures, all variations permitted <span class="variation2">b</span>y the twenty-five orthographical sym<span class="variation2">b</span>ols, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut not a single example of a<span class="variation2">b</span>solute nonsense. It is useless to o<span class="variation2">b</span>serve that the <span class="variation2">b</span>est volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Com<span class="variation2">b</span>ed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no dou<span class="variation2">b</span>t <span class="variation2">b</span>e justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is ver<span class="variation2">b</span>al and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary. I cannot com<span class="variation2">b</span>ine some characters
      <br><br>
      dhcmrlchtdj
      <br><br>
      which the divine Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terri<span class="variation2">b</span>le meaning. No one can articulate a sylla<span class="variation2">b</span>le which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumera<span class="variation2">b</span>le hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n num<span class="variation2">b</span>er of possi<span class="variation2">b</span>le languages use the same voca<span class="variation2">b</span>ulary; in some of them, the sym<span class="variation2">b</span>ol li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary allows the correct definition a u<span class="variation2">b</span>iquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is <span class="variation2">b</span>read or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)
      <br><br>
      The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that everything has <span class="variation2">b</span>een written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves <span class="variation2">b</span>efore <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks and kiss their pages in a <span class="variation2">b</span>ar<span class="variation2">b</span>arous manner, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevita<span class="variation2">b</span>ly degenerate into <span class="variation2">b</span>anditry, have decimated the population. I <span class="variation2">b</span>elieve I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is a<span class="variation2">b</span>out to <span class="variation2">b</span>e extinguished, <span class="variation2">b</span>ut the Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorrupti<span class="variation2">b</span>le, secret.
      <br><br>
      I have just written the word "infinite".' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical ha<span class="variation2">b</span>it; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those who judge it to <span class="variation2">b</span>e limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceiva<span class="variation2">b</span>ly come to an end - which is a<span class="variation2">b</span>surd. Those who imagine it to <span class="variation2">b</span>e without limit forget that the possi<span class="variation2">b</span>le num<span class="variation2">b</span>er of <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks does have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient pro<span class="variation2">b</span>lem: The Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would <span class="variation2">b</span>e an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened <span class="variation2">b</span>y this elegant hope 4.
      <br><br>
      Translated <span class="variation2">b</span>y J. E. I.
      <br><br>
      The original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation has <span class="variation2">b</span>een limited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two letters of the alpha<span class="variation2">b</span>et are the twenty-five sym<span class="variation2">b</span>ols considered sufficient <span class="variation2">b</span>y this unknown author. (Editor's note.)
      <br>
      2. Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeaka<span class="variation2">b</span>le melancholy: at times I have traveled for many nights through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a single li<span class="variation2">b</span>rarian.
      <br>
      3. I repeat: it suffices that a <span class="variation2">b</span>ook <span class="variation2">b</span>e possi<span class="variation2">b</span>le for it to exist. Only the impossi<span class="variation2">b</span>le is excluded. For example: no <span class="variation2">b</span>ook can <span class="variation2">b</span>e a ladder, although no dou<span class="variation2">b</span>t there are <span class="variation2">b</span>ooks which discuss and negate and demonstrate this possi<span class="variation2">b</span>ility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.
      <br>
      4. Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has o<span class="variation2">b</span>served that this vast Li<span class="variation2">b</span>rary is useless: rigorously speaking, a single volume would <span class="variation2">b</span>e sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite num<span class="variation2">b</span>er if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid <span class="variation2">b</span>odies are the superimposition of an infinite num<span class="variation2">b</span>er of planes.) The handling of this silky vade mecum would not <span class="variation2">b</span>e convenient: each apparent page would unfold into other analogous ones; the inconceiva<span class="variation2">b</span>le middle page would have no reverse.
