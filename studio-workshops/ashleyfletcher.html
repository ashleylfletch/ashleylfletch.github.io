    <h2 style="color:#228B22;">Mia's Online Habits</h2>

    <!-- In the <p></p> tags, write a paragraph about your partner's online
    habits. -->
    <p>
    Mia likes to watch YouTube while eating. She uses Instagram as her main way
    to communicate with her friends because she lives in Arizona away from her
    friends in New York. She also uses Snapchat mainly for the memories feature
    as well as to chat with a couple of people. When Mia is on Twitter, she
    likes to mindlessly scroll through the platform. She also recently
    re-downloaded Bumble where she spent a little bit of time making her profile
    and exploring the app. Mia loves to take pictures throughout the day, so the
    camera and photo apps are both heavily used by her.

	 <!-- In the quotes below, copy and paste a quote from the person you interviewed.  -->
	<blockquote>
		“My favorite app is Spotify because I constantly need to have music on. I
    use music when I'm trying to sleep, when I'm cooking, driving, all the time.
    I also love following my friends and seeing what music they're listening to.”
    <br> — Mia Gilling

    <!-- Ask your partner a website they visited recently that surprised them. -->

A recent website that Mia has visited was Healthline, where she read an article
about how to fix her circadian rhythm because her sleep schedule has been out of
hand recently. From this article, she learned that going to sleep and waking up
at the same time, and reducing the use of screens before bed could help improve
her sleep cycle.<br>

    <!-- Ask your partner what fruit they think of themselves as -->

    If Mia was a fruit she would be a lime because at first, she can seem sour;
    people may be intimidated or put off by her because she's quiet and
    introverted. However, when you put lime into other foods you know it’s good;
    when you put Mia in a group setting, she thrives just like lime.<br><br>
